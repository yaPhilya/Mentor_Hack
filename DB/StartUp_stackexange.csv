"1","Is my LLC required to have a registered agent?","<p>After registering my small LLC, I signed up for a registered agent service because it is required for businesses in New Hampshire. I later heard that a member or manager of an LLC can also serve as a registered agent.</p>

<p>From reading sites offering these services it seems the main purpose of a registered agent is to receive service of process. That way you won't be embarassed if you are served in front of customers or partners. It's also useful if you can't hold regular business hours. Not having a representative of the company receive service of process could result in your company losing by default.</p>

<p>I'm not worried about being embarassed in front of customers (it's an online business), but is it really risky to be your own registered agent? Would someone really knock once, fail to serve papers, and not attempt to make any more contact? It seems that it's mostly the registered agent services promoting this mindset, so I'm sure if I should listen to them.</p>

"2","Dividing profits amongst developers and designers","<p>If I have a startup that produces apps, is there a clean way of dividing profits gained from each app amongst only the developers that worked on it?</p>

<p>For instance if my startup were to make an app that simply used native widgets and required no design work, it doesn't really make sense that the designer should share fully in the revenue from that app. It's far to much book keeping to keep track of everyone who worked on every app. Even more so when you try to factor in time spent or effort put in. In addition, it seems to me that splitting profits in this way would work to divide the members of the startup. Does anyone have a clean solution to this problem, one that gives credit where credit is due but also keeps unity?</p>

<p>As a founder, my company is currently an S-Corp, and we have a few employees working on W2s. The other founder and I got together and mapped out Common Stock (Hard, Founder's Equity), but we have about ten other people helping us with various tasks, and we want to formalize their contributions with paper.</p>

<p>Since our company is still at zero revenue, which makes more sense?</p>

<p>Granting stock options that vest over time, or restricted stock? Our par value per share is still negligible,  so something makes me think that stock options are favorable.</p>

<p>Eventually we start the company and my partner gets a very rewarding percentage of the company, yet my part is greater, since the idea is mine and I've put most of the effort into it. He puts some money into the company to get it going but most of our funding are external.</p>

<p>After a year or so (me and my team, which we hired, have made a working prototype of the system and the development of the actual system is in progress) it turns out that this partnership is not quite working out.</p>

<ul>
<li>My partner is too busy to fulfill his duties at the company (a long time has passed and even after pointing it out to him a sufficient fix it not being made).</li>
<li>My partner is somewhat repulsive towards potential associates, not intentionally though. It's just his character, and well, perhaps he's too focused on bragging about old successes to be able to focus on new ones so that the important chat is not lead into the correct direction. I'm forced to attend critical meetings on my own to avoid situations where he'd partly be making fools out of ourselves.</li>

<p>The idea of not micro-managing people and let the company organically evolve by intrinsic motivation of the individual seems very intriguing to me. Yet I have some reservations as to whether it actually works with critical topics such as defining one's own income and handling difficult individuals. For a startup there are also other considerations, like opinion of possible investors and partners.</p>

<p>So my question is: in what situations does it work? In what situations does it not work? And is it generally recommendable and does it work as good as it sounds?</p>

<p>Playing the ""tax game"" is clearly something that can determine how much money we pay in early stages, when we get bought out, etc., therefore I believe it is valuable to consider if and when I should write this letter to the IRS (I am American).</p>

<p>I understand that the letter must be written in 30 days, and I understand what it is, essentially (the ability to pay taxes par value at present date, rather than the taxes of the shares when we sell out). For those who don't know, <a href=""http://ayrlaw.com/what-is-an-83b-election-and-when-do-i-make-it-part-1-with-graphic/"">they are described here</a>.</p>

<p>However, my best business adviser (has sold companies for personal gains upwards of $50m) recommended we stay away from the 83(b) election for the sake of making trades and seeing big drops in stock prices, and still having to pay the tax based on the old, higher share price.</p>

<p>After reading, it seems like it's always a good thing (but my adviser clearly advised against this). I think a good answer to this question would adequately list when a business would consciously make the decision <em>not to enroll</em> and <strong><em>why</strong> they chose not</em> to enroll.</p>

<p>In short, and to make sure I don't get opinionated responses, can we limit this to factual relationships between scenarios where a business <em>would</em> and <em>would not</em> enroll in the 83(b) election.</p>

<p>When Microsoft wanted a PC in every home in 1975, this was very ambitious. And as far as I know, they didn't communicate this goal to their customers...</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> To clarify matters, I am not talking about the idea (which should be freely communicated to everybody) but about the greater vision, which is enabled by the idea. For example: </p>

<p>Idea: Internet-/crowd-based encyclopedia. </p>

<p>Vision: Gather all of humanities knowledge in one place and make it freely accessible.</p>

<p>Now that Wikipedia is 13 years old, this vision is almost reality. Before the first entry, things were quite different... and one could have been laughed at for making such an ambitious claim.</p>

<p>My co-founder and I had recently decided to give her a relatively small amount of equity, less than 3%, when going through our documentation to file our S-Corp. Incidentally, I had been arguing that she had done far less than .01 or .005 (half-to-1-percent) of the total work in the company. I thought 3% was extremely generous.</p>

<p>Reality is, she felt like, because her number was low, that we were not valuing her as part of our team, and this came to us as quite a shock. We have been working on this startup for 18 months, and she had done nothing to contribute until maybe 6-8 months ago.</p>

<p>Without going into further detail, I was amazed to realize how unsure I was of how to handle this decision. Clearly we never increased the equity we gave her, but we had to convince her that her equity had nothing to do with her value to the company, but that it was just a measurement of risk, that some of us had taken far more risk than others (I had barely scraped through my senior year of college, amassing 6-figure loans, and turned down an offer at Google - my business partner dropped out entirely).</p>

<p>But, come to think of it, was I <em>misleading her?</em> Clearly she had not contributed as much, but should I have tried to relate that she was not as valuable as she had somehow thought?</p>

<p>She's clearly a person, and we think she's great. She just has been working jobs and living comfortably while the rest of us eat ramen :) and I'm unsure of how I handled this situation.</p>

As my reputation seems to be growing, I've had a number of potential clients actively approach me looking for work to be done, but I just don't have the time. However, cash-flow can be inconsistent. Are there any good guidelines that more experienced entrepreneurs have come up with about when is appropriate to make the leap and try to find a business partner to disperse the work?

<p>I'm a developer, and I have been for quite some time. Longer than many adults I've met, in fact. I've worked with several clients who've actually appreciated my age, but I often worry about what it will be like when I'm ready to expand my business, a time that's rapidly approaching.</p>

But there just aren't many developers out there who are as young as I am and ready to get going (that is, who aren't currently attending university). That's less and less true every year as I get older, of course, but as my business grows and I start thinking about hiring on some extra hands, I wonder what the result might look like if I hire someone who is umpteen years my senior.

<p>So are there any good tips on how to be taken seriously as a boss who's significantly younger than your employees? Or is this just a nonissue and most people are alright with it? Obviously I recognize that the hiring process would weed out some less enthusiastic potential hires.</p>

<p>I do actually have a team now in India, but I'm pretty sure they don't know my age. I also didn't hire them on, they've been assigned to me through a client. So I have management experience, more or less. This isn't a question of skill or ability (<a href=""https://startups.stackexchange.com/questions/64/can-young-people-start-up"">Can young people start-up?</a>), but more just logistics.</p>

<p>I'm also focusing this question particularly on my age. The gap between a 19 year old and a 24 year old, as I'm sure we all know, is much wider than that between a person who's 40 and one who's 45. I suspect the latter would be a bit easier an age difference to live with.</p>

Originally, we had awarded them X%, despite them coming into the company about 6 months after we had got it started (which I get is still early).</p>

<li><p>My co-founder and I both hold about 2.5X equity, each. We are starting to believe this is part of the reason they are lazy - we worry they feel they can work 2.5 less and 'get by.' We aren't okay with this.</p></li>

"354","Is it better for a tech founder to be highly skilled or well rounded?","<p>This question really bugs me, so I have to ask it.</p>

<p>The tech community, especially in the past few years, has become quite worthy of satire. With shows like <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon_Valley_(TV_series)"">Silicon Valley</a>, there has been no shortage of all the hype the tech community brings to the startup community.</p>

<p>Having gone to school for four years, I saw an amazing amount of software being built by people who <em>thought they wanted to do startups.</em> </p>

<p>The reality is, these programmers had very unique traits which I observed:</p>

<h1>Advantages</h1>

<ul>
<li>They are good at making stuff</li>
<li>They can put in a lot of hours</li>
<li>They like their own ideas</li>
</ul>

<h1>Disadvantages</h1>

<ul>
<li>They have little understanding of how real people behave</li>
<li>Their ideas are often very impractical or inapplicable</li>
<li>They have no idea what makes a good user experience</li>
</ul>

<p>What I've drawn from all of this, is that people are wasting so much time writing <em>bad code.</em> I don't mean erroneous, sloppy, or even inefficient code. I mean that people are spending so much time writing code that nobody will ever use - and often these people think that their app is the next Zuckerbergian release.</p>

<p>I just rarely see tech people get anything done that people use, except the one out of a million billion dollar breakthroughs. </p>

<p>Some parallel questions, to reduce on any sort of opinionated response:</p>

<p>Does specialization fall apart in a company when there is a lack of relationship between different business verticals (software, marketing, etc.)? I just don't get why the world is building so many inapplicable (but often highly skilled) programmers who have no idea how to write code that is <em>economical.</em></p>

Their pricing is very competitive and the massive breath of features offered along with the system/scalability has me nearly convinced to use them for my hosting and data storage.</p>

<p>Has anyone had problems or know about drawback form their free usage tier.  Their free server is not enough for production, but the level above is cheap especially if traffic will start slow anyway.</p>

<p>Would anyone propose a competative to use for hosting and data storage?  <a href=""http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/sites/"">Rackspace</a>?  They charge $150/month and might be bought out by a larger company anyway.</p>

<p>I plan on using a LAPP stack (PostgreSql instead of MySQL since I am using the PostGIS spatial addon).  My app was written using Symfony2 and there is a nice bundle for AWS, plus AWS has a detailed guide for configuring a site using Symfony2 specifically.  I think Google has similar detail and I feel that this upfront support will help.  Last thing I want is to run into an error with the web server and have their tech support tell me they do not support using Symfony2.</p>

<p>PS - Is it possible to have AWS and hosting added as Tags?  Not many tags are available.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>
After a few more months of development, I reviewed hosting and went with AWS, but Rackspace has nice features and probably better support.  I chose AWS because of their configurations and even though it was a steep learning curve, I like the control I have over the server and pricing is the cheapest, but not drastically cheaper than other services.  My database has close to 1 million rows now and I do expect up to 1,000 simultaneous users at peak and I think AWS was easy enough to scale as users connect and scale down after peak time is over.</p>

<p><strong>Update June 2015</strong></p>

<p>I launched my company a few months ago and while I have not had a large spike in traffic, all of the AWS services work very well.  There is a steep learning curve.  I use EC2 with a Load Balancer, Elasticbeanstalk, S3, RDS, Route53, SES, and VPC.  There are actually several services I am not using to keep things <em>simple</em>.</p>

<p>Even though these are a lot of services, they do work well together and I think in the end you can save a lot of money by paying for the services you need and easily adjust if changes are needed.  There is a large community of users that have posted on aws forums, stackoverflow and other exchange sites.  I have been able to solve all of my problems by using this community and that's a big advantage.  I will keep using AWS for a while and if I have to switch, it will be a major rebuild.</p>

<p>To regain costs spent on acquiring users I would need them mine <code>Bitcoins</code> for ~10 years. Before system was built I could not see a way to measure what costs on getting one user will be due to to many factors. </p>

 I could not afford to wait for users to come to me, so I was rather willing to throw money at it. Another problem which is specific to Bitcoin business is getting critical mass of users mining for it to be able to produce consistent payouts.<br /> We are talking on 500+ users in a matter of 1-2 weeks otherwise users get tired of mining without getting paid and will leave.

<p><strong>Open coworking space</strong> - Cheapest option where all you get is a desk for yourself.  I worry about distractions and am not likely to choose this, but are these environments good for networking and collaboration? I've never been in one before and could potentially consider it as a first step before I hire anyone as an intermediary space when it's just myself as the sole employee.</p>

<p><strong>Small private office in an coworking office like <a href=""https://www.wework.com/location/bryant-park/"">WeWork</a></strong> - They offer services to help with HR, tax, payroll, printing, web connections, etc and sounds like a great resource.  Any drawbacks?  Not too expensive either given the services they help with but not cheap.</p>

<p><strong>Separate office in a commercial building</strong> - what used to be the only option.  Can get good deals and choose any location, but sectioned off and may be awkward when trying to setup meetings or the first hire since there will only be 1 person in the office to start.  While monthly costs can be lower than option 2, There will be a lot of startup costs for office furniture and time spent sorting out all of the vendors (internet, payroll, water cooler).</p>

<p>FYI - I'm located in NY and there is a great community here.  I've done nearly all of my work remotely and do not meet people face to face much, but that will need to change soon and opening an office is a big step.  Not sure if I will even get to that but it helps to plan.</p>

<p>Option 1 is obviously the best yet not as common as one would like, so most startups have to take options 2 and 3.<br>
The problem with options 2 and 3 is you have to trust someone with all your ideas who can screw you over most, someone who knows how to 'get around' things.
Thing to note 3 is going to be expensive and you still don't get any guarantees.
Problem with 2 is how to tell that lawyer is competent and can protect business properly from competitors not overbuying patents and not being to loose when you have no idea about the law yourself? Someone is going to suggest to get lawyer by recommendation from someone you know, but I have found it difficult to do personally as one needs business (not a divorce) lawyer and they are usually hard to come by.<br>

I have some great ideas but am frustrated with how much time it takes to get a prototype running.

<li>Get them to pay for being listed with full information and further benefits?</li>
<li>Or only for being ""Featured"" at the top of the directory list?</li>
<li>Or Monetize by mainly by selling ad space?</li>

<p>In the first place, I do not aim for a 100 per cent accuracy. It may also be possible to make a projection. It is extremely important to track those sales, as it is a key performance indicator for our business.</p>

<li>Ask the consumer (per mail) if there was a sale after contacting the dealer. Actually, nobody will answer that question without incentive.</li>
<li>Ask the dealer. They are quite lazy so that would not work very well, either.</li>

"753","How can I make my product economically feasible?","<p>Background: My product extracts data from pdf files. Free users get 8 free jobs. Paying users get 40 jobs. Each job is a data extraction from a pdf file.</p>

<p>Problem: User engagement terminates after they run into a bad extraction. On some pdf files it just doesn't work, it returns empty data. Most times it extracts data but not exactly to what the user had in mind (duplicate, mismatching column, unwanted data). Right after this happens, the user will either try a few more times with other pdf files or just give up and never return again. To fix the cases where it returns empty data, it takes me at least 10 hours. </p>

<p>Concern: I can't support myself to work on such fixes and I can't see the number of bad data extraction that needs to be fix decreasing for each user. It's very tough problem to extract data from pdf files, it's never perfect but I was hoping it was good enough for some users. Even a paying user with their number of fix requests, I would have a hard time getting to them all. The bigger problem is that I priced is cheap so I would get more users, turns out this would lead to a far greater number of problems being encountered with the data extraction process.</p>

<p>Search for solution: My immediate thought is to ditch the free plan, increase the product price and somehow deal with the number of fixes being requested and barely breakeven. </p>

<p>I don't know if anyone's been in this situation, it almost seems like the end user cares about the result of the data extraction unlike say a bookkeeping web application that has a much narrow scope of problems expected. Like if a pdf doesn't extract correctly, it's of no value to the user so they will want this to be fixed right? And as they keep encountering more and more fixes I won't be able to keep up....</p>

Our software is too good. It's too stable. Bad things almost never happen, and when they do happen it's often not caused by our software.</p>

<p>I've heard that enterprises often want support contracts and SLAs as safety nets, so that when things go wrong they can call someone. But that's not my experience.

<p>Given this situation, how can I better sell support contracts? Is there anything I can do to make customers feel that the money they paid for the support contracts wasn't wasted?

<p>While observing 50 users so far I notice that the user engagement seems to terminate after they run the job for the first time. Even if it is successful. Some users run it a few more times but the result is the same, they leave and never come back or they come back run a job and leave again. Another observation is that 30 out of 50 users never created any jobs (they must label the pdf using the web app before extraction can happen, I explain how to do it in the demo video).</p>

"796","""Date Founded"" for a Product Revival","<p>I have a product that I'm bringing back to life. My father wrote it as a side project back in the days of VB 6.0 (it was a simpler time) and it only really had one client, but that client stayed on for around ten years. We thought a couple times about updating it over that time, but ultimately the ROI just didn't support taking up either of our time.</p>

<p>We're looking now to resurrect that project and make it a bit more modern and profitable, and I'm curious of whether it's reasonable to say we were founded in 1996, or if it's safer to just go with, well, a week or two ago.</p>

<p>I'm not so much concerned with the legality of it all, we have a pretty good claim to the trademark, and we've had a one-page website for it for as long as I can remember, basically just saying ""this site is under construction"" with no intent to update it. But I am wondering about the ethics and practicality.</p>

<p>From what I can tell, the main concerns would be:</p>

<ul>
<li>People's expectations, particularly during a beta, where it might not look or act like software that's been alive for nearly twenty years.</li>
<li>Potential users doing some research and learning that while, yes, it was founded back then, that's not exactly evidence of any sort of experience.</li>
<li>Just in general, it could be viewed as misleading, since the project wasn't really taken all that seriously in the past.</li>
<li>Less significantly, if people will take it less seriously because they associate it with being old.</li>
</ul>

<p>Of course, there are certain advantages too, marketing being number one. Particularly having a viable date <em>before 2000</em> seems like it could be a very good tool.</p>

<p>Am I forgetting anything? Are there pros or cons of picking either the new or old date? Or are there standards off of which I should be making this decision? And I know I said I'm not overly concerned with legality, but as a bonus, have there been any precedent-setting cases wherein a company was (or was not) found to be using false advertising through similar means?</p>

<p>Maybe it doesn't even matter, and founding date is simply a legacy term that people don't really care about in tech any more?</p>

<p>I do think it's noteworthy to mention, as I've implied, that we're keeping the same name, and obviously it's the same kind of program, with the same goals in mind.</p>

<p>Clearly it still matters in many service industries, but is founding date irrelevant in the tech world? When the whole industry is moving forward to really review the past, maybe listing a founding date is actually a bad thing for marketing?

"810","Getting a loan to build necessary facilities for the business","<p>My business is currently operating out of a large garage/shop building on our personal property. It's been great to have that available because it means the business doesn't have to worry about rent/mortgage for the time being.</p>

<p>But it's growing, and I expect it to keep growing, and it likely won't be too long before I outgrow the building we have.</p>

<p>That's a great problem to have, but I also don't want to be caught with my proverbial pants down and be unprepared when we get there.</p>

<p>I live in a rural area, and there isn't much available here for rent or purchase that would suit the needs of my business. So I'm considering either buying land (which is plentiful and relatively inexpensive here) and building on it or moving to a less rural area and either building or buying a building there.  Much of that decision will probably end up depending on the cost differences between building vs buying and modifying it to meet my needs.</p>

<p>But my question is two-fold:</p>

<p>First, how hard is it for a fledgling business to get a loan to build (or buy?) a facility for light industrial processes (small scale manufacturing operations) and warehousing? </p>

<p>Second, what things can I do to slant the odds in my favor?</p>

<p>Obviously having a successful business is going to help, and being able to show growing revenues and responsible spending will help. But by nature of being a newly established business, those records don't go back very far - will that be enough?</p>

<p>I know with a home loan they say they want you to be able to show a stable income for at least 2 years - what if my business is younger than 2 years old when I hit that space bottleneck (and ideally I want to start this all in motion BEFORE hitting that bottleneck since it will take time).

<p>There is already a decent market out there for the mass produced widgets in a variety of different styles. But people are incredibly excited to be able to design their own widgets.  </p>

<p>So the market for custom widgets is a subsection of the overall market for widgets (plus a small portion that wouldn't want the standard widgets). But how do you determine the size of the subsection if no one has directly marketed to it before?</p>

Over the last few years, businesses have begun to see opportunity in that and have started to capitalize off of that via social marketing campaigns and humorous profiles, allowing them to build one-on-one relationships with their otherwise-mass-marketed target demographics.</p>

<p>At what point does it become necessary (or beneficial at all, for that matter) for a business to have an active presence on social media platforms? I'm speaking in particular about tech companies with consumer-based products, although I'd be curious to hear any cross-applicability with non-tech SMBs, so bonus points to anyone who includes some insight about those as well.</p>

<p>Does having a launched product automatically mean that a business owner should create Facebook, Twitter, Google+, and Tumblr accounts? Maybe it even needs to happen ahead of time to build hype? Are there good rules or guidelines to tell me when the right time is to start such profiles?</p>

<p>Are there advantages or disadvantages to starting one early? Does having one lead to unforeseen responsibilities? If I can't devote a ton of resources to keeping it active, are there downfalls in holding inactive profiles, where only a baseline of responding to active customer-inquiries is met?</p>

"906","How to find a hardware engineer?","<p>I've considered starting a new company which builds and sells a hardware (e.g. Nest), but I don't know how to find a hardware engineer to build the product. If it's just a question like ""Hey, I have a good business idea and want to get people who write code, how can I find those engineers?"", it's easy enough because there're many, many people out there who are freelance software engineers and they also show up at a local tech conference or hackathon, and most of those apps can be developed by a couple of or only one person in a small company. However I think there are very few or no such people as ""freelance hardware engineers"" and I also think most hardware engineers work for a company (usually a really big company), and I cannot get in touch with them easily.</p>

<p>So what do people who are going to incorporate a hardware startup do to find a hardware engineer? Most app developers might be able to write code in all of iOS, Android, Web, and server as long as you give him some time in a small company, but is that also true of hardware engineers? In other words, how is it possible for people who build a Nest product to also build a tablet, headphone, or an air-conditioner?</p>

<p>Also, how many people are required to build hardware? Is it possible to hire only one, talented engineer and let him do everything? I think that the job of hardware engineers is prescribe how to build it, and the actual people who builds it are employees of companies like Foxconn, right?</p>

<p>Lastly, I've even considered enrolling at an university again to learn about it myself. There are some departments that seem relevant, such as mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, and materials science and engineering, but which one is the best to enroll in? Are the resources learned in universities enough to leg up building the hardware?</p>

<li>Allow employees to pick whatever hours they want, as long as they produce good work and attend whatever meetings we may have--if that means they can work from home a few days a week, that's fine.</li>

We have run into some challenges when it comes to recording the correct amount on the books when our customers make purchases abroad. Apparently, the publicly available day-rates reported by Mastercard cannot be used, because the exchange rate applied by Mastercard is that of the day the money is recorded - and NOT the rate of the day the actual purchase was made (there is a varying delay of typically 2-5 days). </p>

<p>We have therefore found ourselves in a situation where we might need access to our customers' Mastercard transactions where the correct exchange rate is implied by the amount in foreign and local currency. However, we have been unable to find any information about how we can go about this matter in technical terms. We heard rumors that we need to be PCI compliant and Mastercard possibly could send a .CSV file on a regular basis - granted we have consent from our customers. I know that many businesses (such as Mint.com) has this feature where people can import their personal credit card purchases.</p>

<li>Founders - 67% </li>

"943","VC contributions to a company - resources other than finances?","<p>I've seen several questions posted about how to impress or get the attention of venture capitalists so they see your vision as a worthwhile investment.</p>

<p>But I've begun to wonder about the VC-startup relationship from a different angle:</p>

<p>Aside from the obvious financial contributions, what (if anything) is a venture capitalist expected to contribute to the relationship?</p>

<p>For example, I've been watching a few episodes of Shark Tank this week (never watched it before). I'm not watching it because I expect it to be an accurate representation of what it is like to approach venture capitalists in the real world, I simply find it fascinating. On the show, the ""Sharks"" are often selling themselves and what they bring to the deal besides the money - they talk about relationships they have with various distribution channels, experience they have in certain markets, etc.</p>

<p>Obviously the VC wants their investment to have the best chance possible of actually earning money, but in the ""real world"", if a VC commits $500k (or maybe $50k? or 5M?) to your startup, is there also an expectation that they are going to commit other non-financial resources to helping your startup succeed?</p>

<p>Something I find interesting about Shark Tank is that often the non-financial investment apparently being offered seems more valuable than the actual money on the table.</p>

<p>I've personally shied away from any strong consideration of seeking investments from venture capitalists if possible. Because at least for where I'm at now, I'd rather grow the business organically and maintain full ownership.</p>

<p>But it's possible that is partly due to a misunderstanding of how the relationship works.  If VCs commonly contribute their other resources like industry connections and experience, it would certainly make that type of relationship more appealing to me.</p>

<p>From a business standpoint, it's hard not to see that amount of money sitting in the account as underutilized - but where is that line between responsible management of funds and under-utilizing financial resources?</p>

Think of it like Yelp for the Internet, a place to go when you want to find not just the first result on a search page, but the best website for what you're looking to do. </p>

<p>The problem is, without a userbase I have very little content so far, and without much content I'm having a hard time attracting a userbase.</p>

<p>The people I've shown it to seem to think it has a good chance of getting some popularity. Everyone has opinions about Facebook and Netflix and such, and I know A LOT of people looking for a good dress shopping site, or a new writing group, or the best online dating site, etc. And just like with restaurants and stores on Yelp, everyone wants to tell people about their favorite websites, and everyone wants to warn others of the terrible experiences they've had online. Many people who have seen the site have described it as one of those ""I never knew I wanted this"" ideas, so I'm (tentatively) enthusiastic about its chances.</p>

<p>But while I've added over 300 websites to the database so far with more coming every day, and we're starting to get more and more people submitting their own websites as well, we don't have nearly as many people writing reviews. I've written a bunch myself, and I'm trying to rally my friends and family as well, but obviously this is an uphill battle and a short-term patch, not a real solution. A review site lives and dies five the number and quality of reviews that its users submit. I'm experimenting with paid advertising on a number of platforms to increase the traffic, but it looks like so far people are coming to the site, looking around, murmuring ""neat"", and then leaving. And without much content to read, I can't really blame them.</p>

How can I set up my website to allow users to input a credit card that then automatically gets billed monthly, with minimal human intervention?</p>

<p>As I understand it, QuickBooks does what I want, kind of. But that requires human intervention (practically speaking, at least). It'll be relatively low-volume, so I <em>could</em> theoretically just accept credit card information and manually via a regular <code>TextBox</code>, then feed myself an alert to copy that into QuickBooks (or equivalent) every time someone signs up. But that seems like it could become cumbersome pretty quickly, not to mention nothing would be validated (beyond the unimpressive checksums you can find online) until I had gotten around to typing it up.</p>

<p>I looked around online, but all the solutions I can find are for one-off purchases (like in a web-based store).</p>

<p>Just as examples, and they clearly have to deal with higher loads than I would, an ideal solution would be something like I imagine Netflix, Hulu Plus, SharePoint Online, etc. would use. I suspect <em>they</em> don't have someone sitting and copying over everyone's credit card information.</p>

"1004","App Marketing with little or no budget","<p>I am an indie app developer with little budget and I am about to launch an application. I think my app is really useful and I think it meets a market need. I need to know how I can advertise my app with little or no budget. To be more specific, my question is:</p>

<p>Are there agencies willing to ""sell"" my app for a percentage of my gains once the app is published? I'm looking specifically for something with preferably with little or no up-front cost.</p>

<p>I wrote the application on my own and my knowledge is centered on coding, so I'm looking for an agency that can perform market research, advertise, and handle those types of administrative tasks in exchange of a percentage of my revenues.</p>

<p>I feel that my app has a lot of potential, and I need to focus on development, so I don´t want to unnecessarily divert my energy into learning about the marketing side.</p>

<p>I live in Argentina, if that's relevant.</p>

"1026","Pros/cons of an ""umbrella corporation"" versus individual corps/llcs for parallel entrepreneur?","<p>I'm familiar with the concept of parallel entrepreneurship, but there's a couple of points I'm not sure on:</p>

<p>Let's say over the next several years I wanted to start up several ventures which are completely unrelated (broad examples: publishing, SaaS, e-commerce, and manufacturing).</p>

<p>What are the benefits of setting up an umbrella corporation to own each of the individual startups vs having them completely separate?</p>

<p>Assume that I'm not going to be the only founder of all of these, but would have a majority share in each (meaning the corporation would own whatever percentage of the company belonged to me and I would have full ownership of the corporation).</p>

<p>Does any of the pros/cons change if I were to own only a minority share of any of these startups?</p>

<p>This is similar to this question: <a href=""https://startups.stackexchange.com/questions/118/using-an-umbrella-llc-to-spawn-brands-with-different-focuses"">Using an umbrella LLC to spawn brands with different focuses?</a></p>

<p>But I am not talking about just tacking on additional brands to the main company, I'm talking about separate entities which are all fully autonomous and incorporated businesses all owned by a single corporation.</p>

<p>What determines entrepreneurial success?</p>

<hr>

<p><em>What is entrepreneurial success?</em></p>

<p>As noted by <a href=""https://startups.stackexchange.com/a/1050/1141"">@daOnlyBG</a>, in the context of this question, I'll offer a broad definition of success. I understand there may be other definitions of success which will produce different answers. I realize my definition of success may be naive, but a definition is in order. Let's define entrepreneurial success as (1) firm survival, (2) firm revenue growth, and (3) firm employment growth.</p>

<p><em>What kind of answer do I expect?</em></p>

<p>There are plenty of opinions on what makes start-ups successful. These opinions are found in popular press business books, online, TV, radio, magazines, etc... I am <strong>not</strong> looking for another opinion. I am looking for <strong>data</strong>. By data I mean, <strong>academic research published in a reputable peer-reviewed journal or an academic book by a team of professors from a reputable, accredited university</strong>. The accepted answer should have a description of the factors that make a start-up successful along with a link to the original academic study, following my example. Additionally, avoid creating a new answer. Instead, add to the most comprehensive answer below. </p>

<p><em>Why did I answer my own question?</em></p>

<p>I'm going to answer my own question with the research that I have done, with the intention of the answer becoming a <strong>master list of entrepreneurial success factors</strong>. I intend for this answer to be continually updated as new academic research is published. In other words, the answer I provide below is NOT meant to be exhaustive. It is meant to be a start for a <strong>community wiki</strong>, similar to this <a href=""https://quant.stackexchange.com/questions/141/what-data-sources-are-available-online"">question</a>. I'm going to provide a short answer to get the ball rolling and add to it as I find new research and hope that you add your own research to this answer.</p>

The idea for the company &amp; product was initially mine, but I needed to split the costs and have someone to eventually do the management/legal/help aspects of the company, so we teamed up.</p>

<p><strong>The problem is</strong> that my partner hasn't been investing himself much lately. He misses meetings and becomes unreliable with the deadlines. I now have to constantly remind him to help me out, which doesn't seem fair since we split the company assets 50/50.</p>

Astonishingly no-one appears to be providing this service at the moment which means a) it won't work b) is not a good idea or c) no-one has thought of it yet. I am hoping it is the latter!</p>

<p>I have spent a lot of time trying to figure out how to get this idea off the ground, but it needs some serious technical resources (web development etc.) which I cannot do myself and I am unable to pay anyone else to do it.</p>

<p>So I have reluctantly come to the conclusion that if I am going to achieve anything at all with this I will need to attract outside assistance.

<p>Does anyone know of instances where ""Lean Startup"" was a failure or caused significant problems and delays?</p>

<p>For example: one method outlined in ""Running Lean"" (Ash Maurya) is conducting ""problem interviews"" before defining a ""minimal viable product"" - the focus is on solving existing problems real customers have and trying to gauge if there is a real interest in your solutions or how to adapt your solutions to be minimal (to the point) and still attractive and marketable.</p>

<p>What about technological innovation that basically creates ""new problem spaces"" and introduces something to the world that did not exist like that before (such as the telephone, TV, or Internet). Could ""problem interviews"" be a waste of time, when interviewees cannot follow your vision and ideas? I know, you could still argue that the existing problem space before the invention of the telephone was ""long distance communication is difficult and slow"". But were people back then really having that problem and missing something, that would justify the risk of creating the telephone in the sense of ""lean startup""? Both telephone and Internet brought people closer together and created an environment where we expect more from our lives (being able to quickly communicate and socialize online). About 16 years ago I had absolutely no cravings for meeting people online and I got my knowledge from books and the library.</p>

"1138","Converting successful personal projects into Ltd company","<p>I am a software engineer and in my spare time I like to make apps and build websites etc. The motivation has always been to make money but most of the projects I’ve worked on in the past have failed to do that.</p>

<p>Recently however, an app I made a while ago (~1 year) suddenly started generating sales. This rekindled my interest in writing apps and I’ve managed to churn out 3 in the last month.</p>

<p>Luckily these new apps are also making profit. I’m currently making around £150 per month, but in the next week I’m hoping to convert these from Android to iOS, which will hopefully double that figure.</p>

<p>I realise that these figures are small-fry and that this is still at the level of something that should be considered a hobby but I don’t think it’s unrealistic for me to make around 30 apps for both iOS and Android in the coming year, and if (big if!) I can replicate the success I’ve had so far, that might generate a significant profit.</p>

<p>I was wondering if I could get some advice about how I would go about forming a company from all these small projects, as they’re all currently published under my own name. For instance, my developer accounts with both Google and Apple are registered in my name, as are a couple of domain names.</p>

<p>Also, the apps already have sales figures, and reading HMRC and other government pages it says that a company is formed as soon as something generates sales. So how would I deal with historic app sales?</p>

<p>Also I was wondering about how best to structure the company? Is it even worth going Ltd or am I just opening myself up to unnecessary costs and taxes?</p>

<p>I also wouldn’t like to pigeon-hole myself into making one kind of app, so the name that I’m currently using – eduapp – wouldn’t be suitable. Could I form a company called Holding Company Ltd and then trademark the name eduapp and use that as a brand for certain apps?</p>

"1163","How to conduct a contest on a photo-site? And means to promote it","<p>I've opened a photosite. 
It's aimed for a local geographical region.</p>

<p>My initial plan was and is to make this site a local place where people could share their photos, write posts in their blogs and also present their service as professional photographers. </p>

<p>Presence of professionals would open certain possibilities for monetization since professional photography is getting more and more popular and there are more and more professionals in my region.</p>

<p>And potentially popularity would make it possible to cooperate with photo-stores, photo-courser and other related companies.</p>

<p>There are no such sites in my region that I know of.</p>

<p>The site is very simple to use and very user-friendly. So usability is not a problem. The problem is how to attract users?</p>

<p>I made the site local because I'd thought it'd be simpler to promote it on a local level, but it seems it's not so simple (though I didn't start advertising yet).</p>

<p>Here are my thought on the contest: </p>

<p>1) the form of voting is just like/dislike (with compulsory justification which is seen by other users in a form of a comment)</p>

<p>2) in order to take a part in the contest a user must have at least 20 photos in his/her account, that would bring more content</p>

<p>3) allow only one photo from one user</p>

<p>4) only the participants are allowed to vote for other participants</p>

<p>What do you think about it? Would you participate in such contest? If no, then why? 
My goal for now is to bring more content, attract more interested people and make it active.</p>

<p>Another question is how to promote the contest. I want it to be as effective as possible. Now I think primarily of social networks: i'm going to place announcements of the contest in popular communities. Also I'm thinking about forums.

"1190","What is a sensible way to measure customer retention rate?","<p>I run a <a href=""http://bloomingtontutors.com"" rel=""nofollow"">local tutoring business in Indiana</a>, and we employ/contract about 12 tutors to work one-on-one with college students.</p>

<p>Our focus is on repeat business - i.e., we want customers to be satisfied with their tutor, enough to schedule additional sessions with that same tutor.  My goal is to gauge this satisfaction based on whether or not the student schedules a followup session.  If they do, I'd consider this a success, and that the tutor is working out for the student.</p>

<p>What I'd like to do is measure this on the fly, rather than waiting until the end of the semester when the ""votes are in"".  What I've been doing so far is:</p>

<p>At a given time <em>t</em>, count the number of students with whom the tutor has completed a session between the beginning of the semester, and <em>t - (2 weeks)</em>.  Let's call that <em>total_students</em>.  I consider 2 weeks to be a ""reasonable"" amount of time for a followup session to occur.  </p>

<p>Then, count how many of those students have completed <strong>at least one</strong> additional session with the tutor between the beginning of the semester, and now.  Let's call that <em>followup_students</em>.  </p>

<p>I am thus defining the <em>2-week student retention rate</em> for a tutor as <em>followup_students</em> / <em>total_students</em>.  Thus a tutor who never gets a second session with a student will have a retention rate of 0, and a tutor who keeps them coming back will have a retention rate of 1.</p>

<p>However, there are some caveats.  Attrition can happen for a number of reasons, not just poor customer satisfaction:</p>

<ul>
<li>The student could drop the course.  This will hit harder on our tutors who tend to work with students who are struggling more.</li>
<li>The student could be a ""exam-only"" type of student.  Meaning, that they tend not to want to meet with a tutor until right before an exam, and then suddenly it's cram time.  This would make their tutors look bad between the first and second round of exams.</li>
</ul>

<p>Furthermore:</p>

<ul>
<li>Tutors with fewer students are going to bounce around more, since one followup session will make a huge difference.</li>
<li>2 weeks is an arbitrary period of time that I just decided was ""long enough.""</li>
<li>Should I factor in the <em>number</em> of followup sessions (instead of a simple binary model)?</li>
</ul>

<p>In general, does this make sense as a way to evaluate customer retention rate, for my tutors or even for the business as a whole?</p>

To be clear here, I am not looking for an exhaustive list, but any kind of overview (~5 successful, ~5 unsuccessful ones) would probably give a better natural feel for this than a long  legal explanation will.</p>

"1362","Tasteful way to say our company emphasizes good works, recycling, etc?","<p>Up front, I think the problem is me, frankly: I usually try to just quietly go above-and-beyond for our customers, but when we did some asking, many customers didn't know a thing we were doing, for example, recycling, giving percentages of our profit to charity, etc <em>and indicated that they would like to</em>. It's unsurprising that they didn't know -- we really haven't said much about it. I've never been one to blow my own horn, which has bled into the company, I guess, and I've felt very reserved about putting what we do out there externally. </p>

<p>I can now see the value in it however... It helps people know and trust a company. So I'd like to at least have that information available. I just don't know how to tastefully or respectfully mention some of what we're about and what we do without sounding elitist or risking alienating our customers.  </p>

<p>For example, we've been grappling for a couple of days on-and-off about how to say we emphasize a low impact on our packing slips: we recycle all paper and we print on recycled paper, etc. We were going back and forth on exactly HOW to say it without, I suppose, <strong>over</strong>emphasizing it. </p>

"1387","Designer and Marketing role definition in startup","<p>I am involved in a 6 person software based startup and we are about to take on our first UI/UX designer.</p>

<p>This is an important hire as it's something that we have been lacking across our platform (both web &amp; mobile) and no-one has had the design skills or experience to take our UX to the next level. We're deliberately taking on a senior designer for this very reason.</p>

<p>We also have a junior marketeer hired who is working on the brand, sales, product etc who is doing a great job. </p>

<p>It is my intention that the new designer now has sole responsibility of the delivery of the design and the aesthetics across the company, but the marketer is already pushing back on where the responsibilities lie in terms of design, arguing that aesthetics has a huge part in brand positioning and communication, which I can't disagree with.</p>

<p>What I have come up with is tell the marketeer that the sole responsibility of the product design will now be attributed to the designer, but that the marketeer can have sign off of any public deliveries and has a certain degree of veto, as long as any push-back is within the area of marketing.</p>

<p>I know that in a larger organisation we would have a marketing director that designers would then report into, but I don't think that structure suits a small team.</p>

<p>I would love some thoughts on the set up here and how I should define the roles between marketeer and designer in a small business / startup.</p>

Sometimes I feel if I would go on my own way and I would choose my own sales people, the whole development and sales process could be more efficient. I would not conclude meaningless compromises, debates with sales people. The way of development would not be determined by sales people who want to protect their own position, communication channel to clients, but I would set up a product which is already made regard to maintenance purpose, where client can customise / maintain services on GUI, without the need to call us, keep contact, arrange meetings, buy flight ticket, book hotels, etc.</p>

<p>So my personal impression is we are wasting a lot of money, we are not efficient, and I guess these not bothers only me, but at other companies it exist too. Is it any business literature that covers this topic?  I would read more about it or read your opinion. </p>

"1400","What to do when a user wants to ""buy a license"" for free and open source software?","<p>Free and open source software can be <em>freely</em> redistributed with or without changes <em>and</em> with or without a price-tag. As a developer, I am free to sell open source software, which I do.</p>

<p>However, this creates an interesting scenario. Large corporate customers are used to asking software distributors questions like <em>""Do you offer a site license?""</em> -- well, this is tricky, technically, we're not selling a license here, we're selling the binaries. It is not possible to sell a license for the software, since its already licensed under the GPL.</p>

<p>So what do you tell a customer when they want to buy a license? <br />
<em>""Yeah sure, here's a quote.""</em> or <em>""You're actually buying the binaries, here's a quote for that.""</em></p>

<p>The first one is easier for the customer (they're just doing their job) and the second is perhaps more ethical (but confuses the customer).</p>

<p>Technically, I suppose you can impose a ""<strong>license</strong>"" to access the download page and support services -- this seems like the most sensible business strategy. Should you try to educate the user on rights, or just leave them to it? Because they probably don't care.</p>

<p>I've got a decent database of websites so far (about 350 and growing), ranging from tiny startups to giants like Facebook and Netflix and Reddit.  What I don't have are reviews. I've gotten my friends to write as many as I can, and I'm writing reviews for every website I've ever used, but obviously a review site lives and dies by the number of reviews its community generates, and we're not generating many.</p>

<p>I'd like to start partnering with websites, to have them encourage their users/customers to leave reviews on my site the way restaurants and such do on Yelp, but before I do that I need a database large enough to justify the website's participation.</p>

<p>Most of my research has returned tips for getting more paying customers (most of which don't apply because the website is free), getting reviews for a specific product (like if I wrote a book and want Amazon reviews), or getting users for a ""review site"" in the sense of me writing movie reviews on a blog, etc.  I can't find much information about attracting users who will leave reviews on a variety of products.</p>

<ol>
<li><strong><em>Big</em></strong> - these are startups that have become well known in their particular fields and have widespread usage.
<ul>
<li>Examples:
<ul>
<li>Dropbox</li>
<li>Hipmunk</li>
<li>Stripe</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong><em>Upcoming</em></strong> - fairly known in some circles, usage is growing, as is interest.
<ul>
<li>Examples:
<ul>
<li>Algolia</li>
<li>Pushbullet</li>
<li>RethinkDB</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong><em>Beginning</em></strong> - not really known well, but have a ready MVP and are still getting their first few customers. No examples, since if I knew of some, they would be <em>Upcoming</em> by definition.</li>
</ol>

<p>Now, outside of accelerators like this, how does one connect with startups in each of these categories?</p>

<p>This is how I see it with each of these:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong><em>Big</em></strong>
<ul>
<li>Difficult to even get into contact with heads</li>
<li>What do they get from forming a relationship with you?</li>
<li>Approached by many, so if they haven't heard of you, the signal-to-noise ration is very low</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong><em>Upcoming</em></strong>
<ul>
<li>Fairly easy to get into contact with heads</li>
<li>Yet again, however, what do they get out of it?</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong><em>Beginning</em></strong>
<ul>
<li>How do you even find them?</li>
<li>How do you figure out which ones are worth forming a relationship with?</li>
<li>If you're not a customer, what are they getting from you?</li>

They have asked me to form a company and handle marketing/sales/legal/taxes so they can make their art and profit without worrying about those aspects.  This will start with sale of pieces made by one artist to local businesses, and expand to conventions, and internet sales.  </p>

<p>Capital is at a minimum, so I cannot afford to simply purchase the art, I will need to represent the artists, and sell for a commission.  I want to keep my friends concerns of paperwork overhead in mind, what would be the best way for me to carry forward, in regards to corporate formation, and how the artists are treated (as partners, shareholders, employees, ...?).  I have looked into many guides describing the differences between LLC, SP, LLP, S-Corp, and C-Corp, as well as read some standard contracts for brokerage, but still feel very much lost.</p>

<li>I've been taking $1500/week to freelance for him for the past 3 months under the assumption that I will join on eventually. I'm worth $4000-$5000/week from a freelancing standpoint but took the less pay because I believed in the idea</li>
<li>At my previous startup I was paid 175k + 5% equity. I'm very high in demand.</li>
<li>I'm developing an iPhone app and until I get a developer that means I will be doing the backend and Frontend programming (both of which I'm skilled and experienced in)</li>
<li>The CEO plans on giving himself 55%. His father who has paid for the freelancers that he's hired over the past year will get 20%.</li>
<li>We live and work in NYC</li>
<li>We have a great working relationship. We work in the same office and get along great and are always hashing out ideas.</li>

<p>He's offered me 8% / 125k. I told him I don't feel like a cofounder at that amount and asked if 15% / 100k was feasible and he didn't think so. We talked for length about it and I feel like I'm worth a lot more than he's selling me on.</p>

"1552","Finding and researching a small problem to solve (singlehandedly)?","<p>Now, I know the question sounds too abstract, so I'll try to explain. I work in IT industry and have a good amount of understanding of the modern 'technology', meaning I have the means to develop almost anything (software) on major platforms but unfortunately having the means doesn't mean that you can create the best product with your market and customers figured out, one needs to be able to understand the 'problem' in depth. And the best products come from people who solve problems they face themselves. Since I work with startups, most problems I come across are business related, meaning they would solve a problem for a business (B2B). Now if I leave my job and start building a product for a business, I would face one critical problem: I can't focus on sales and marketing while am trying to create the best quality product for businesses, and businesses are in general much more demanding than your average customers. The tool itself needs to be of the highest quality possible, and then there has to be a great support. So basically I don't have the means to provide everything and will have to stick to a small problem that I can solve for regular customers and by myself, I have the capability to handle a smaller problem, for example a chat, or note application. Now the issue here is, well I am very 'do it myself' kind of guy. I very rarely rely on apps to do stuff, for example I only ever use emails,note, calculator, browser on my phone. And there are already very well executed apps for these. So coming to the question.</p>

<p>Where do I begin to research a ""problem"" regular users face, that I may or may not understand, once I pick up the problem, I know how to research further into it. Its just that first ray of light that am looking for. How would 'you' start your research. </p>

<p>What I've already done:
* looked at other startups on angel and tried to find one that I could solve for other market. While this does provide insight into what others are doing, I crave for novelty and even if I ditch novelty, I really didn't find anything that excites me. </p>

<ul>
<li>researched ideas that I find interesting and look for its potential in a new market. I really like the idea of a great unserialised TV app (the universal Windows 10, excites me beyond anything, you can create so much in so little and apple tv/chromecast aren't far behind either), so I researched into it but it seems this won't have a good market for atleast a good 3-5 years.</li>

<ul>
<li>trying to figure out which frameworks would match </li>
<li>how fast I can understand the concepts</li>
<li>how active the community reacts on questions and bugs</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>has REST support</li>
<li>provides database mapping</li>
<li>is free (open source)</li>
<li>...</li>

<p>Luckily but also unfortunately, there are so many web frameworks available, it's not just a matter of deciding between a small number of frameworks. Since I'm employed in parallel (full time), I evaluate frameworks in my free time only, which takes long.</p>

The campaign involved producing content so there was an upfront investment on our part. Several months ago the payment was due, but never came. Timing of payments from this ad network had been inconsistent in the past, so initially we let it slide, but more than a month ago I started asking about it. I received apologies and a new payment date (weeks ago) which came and went. Since then I have been pestering, but responses are slow and unspecific. </p>

<p>First, I want to be paid. Order of magnitude is $10k, which might by peanuts for some, but is significant for our small company.</p>

<p>I read <a href=""https://www.ato.gov.au/Business/GST/How-GST-works/"" rel=""nofollow"">this article</a> about how it works, but I don't quite understand when or how to charge clients in and outside of Australia. As far as I'm aware, <a href=""http://www.kpmg.com/global/en/issuesandinsights/articlespublications/vat-gst-essentials/pages/australia.aspx#1"" rel=""nofollow"">I charge 10% to clients inside of Australia</a>, but how does it work when the client is outside of Australia? I seem to be unable to find anything about that.</p>

<p><strong>[EDIT 11th dec. 2014]</strong></p>

<p>I found <a href=""http://www.startupsmart.com.au/mentor/robert-krigsman/do-i-charge-my-overseas-clients-gst-on-consulting-services.html"" rel=""nofollow"">this</a> article on GST which states that basically if you provide a service outside of Australia if said service's <em>""effective use or enjoyment must occur outside Australia""</em>, it's <em>""not for work performed on any tangible personal property based in Australia""</em>, that it's <em>""not connected with real property in Australia""</em>, and that the client is not inside of Australia when the service is performed, that it falls under GST-Free.  </p>

<p>To me, this indicates that clients outside of Australia are not charged GST.</p>

<p>However, it also says this:  </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>To arrive at an accurate and more definitive conclusion, I would recommend seeking a specific transactional review by a qualified tax professional.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I also found <a href=""http://www.rmit.edu.au/browse/Staff%2FAdministration%2FPolicies%20and%20procedures%2FFinance%20and%20procurement%2FTaxation%2FExports%20-%20GST%20fact%20sheet%2010/"" rel=""nofollow"">this article on the site of RMIT</a> which states the following:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Services exported by RMIT for consumption outside Australia will be GST-free in the following cases:</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>The services relate to goods or real estate outside Australia, eg. If as part of an architecture course at RMIT, a student must design a building for a company or individual, and the student designs one for a non-resident, and the building is to be constructed in another country, his fee will be GST-free.</li>
  <li>Services are provided to a non-resident who is not in Australia at that time.</li>
  <li>Services provided to someone who is not in Australia, and the services are used outside Australia (cannot be directly related to goods or real property in Australia).</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>This also indicated to me that providing services to anyone who is outside of Australia at that time is not charged GST.</p>

"1592","Tax structuring - How to pay no corporate tax?","<blockquote>
  <p>""Tax structuring"". This is another thing. Once things are working it would be worth you spending a little bit of time thinking about how you set up the tax structure for the company. I confess I don't know a lot about the details here 'cause I just find it personally really boring. But like if you assign the IP to some corporation in Ireland that licensing it back to the US Corporation. You end up paying no tax. No corporate tax. But I know that you can only do that relatively early on. And this ends up being a huge issue for companies that don't do it that compete with companies that do it you know once they're big public companies. So that's worth doing.  </p>

"1603","Forward vesting vs Pyramid vesting","<p>Whats the difference between forward vesting and pyramid vesting?<br>
Which one should an early startups and a late stage startups use and why?</p>

<p>This question is based on <a href=""http://startupclass.samaltman.com/courses/lec20/"" rel=""nofollow"">""How to Start a Startup"" - Lecture 20: Later-Stage Advice</a>, by Sam Altman; following is the excerpted from the <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59ZQ-rf6iIc"" rel=""nofollow"">video presentation</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>One thing that I think is really important when it comes to HR is
  equity. Most people get this right now for the early employees. They
  give a lot of equity. But you should continue to give a lot of equity
  all the way through. And this is one place that you investors will
  always give you bad advice. I think - not YC. But all other investors
  give bad advice here. Most do. You should be giving out a lot of
  equity to your employees. Now this dilutes everyone.</p>
  
  <p>Right? This dilutes you as the founder and the investors equally. For
  some reason founder usually understand this as good. Investors are
  very short-sighted and don’t want to dilute themselves so they'll like
  fight you over every equity grant. But, we've seen a lot of data at YC
  now and the most successful companies - and the ones where the
  investors do the best - end up given a lot of stock out to employees.
  Year after year... After year.</p>
  
  <p>So I tell founders, ""You should think about for the next ten years
  you're going to be given out 3- 5 percent of the company every year
  'cause you just get bigger and bigger. So the individual grants gets
  smaller but in actuality it's a lot of stock. This is really important
  to do if you value your people you should be doing this. Specifically,
  you need to do this with refresher grants. And you should get a plan
  in place for this early. You never want an employee in a place where
  they vested 3 out of their four years in stock and they start thinking
  about leaving. So you should ALWAYS stay in front of peoples vesting
  schedules. And you know how they plan early where you have refresher
  grants in place.</p>
  
  <p>There are a lot of new structures that people have been using here. I
  personally like six year big grants - but six years of vesting. 'Cause
  I think these companies take a while to build. There's <strong>pyramid vesting</strong>
  where you back weight someone’s grant. In year four they get a lot
  more of the vesting than year one. There's a concept - different names
  for it, but something like <strong>continuous forward vesting</strong> where people's
  grants are automatically re-upped. Every year. At the same number of
  share. Whatever you decide, get an option management system in place
  at about this point. The normal way people do this is just someone
  keeps an Excel spreadsheet. I have seen mistakes that have cost
  employees or companies tens of millions of dollars because they didn't
  get this right.There's really good option management systems or
  software and you should get those in place around this point.</p>

"1617","Picking the right product for marketing automation","<p>I'm a developer.  I need to setup some marketing automation in my product such that when new users come into my app I want to put them on a program that I will market to them as a new user.  So for example, someone signs up a free trial.  I send them the welcome email with some instructions on what to do next.  Based on what they do in the app, like if they  complete some tasks in my app I want to send them another email telling them what to do next.  If they don't complete these tasks I want to send them a reminder, etc.</p>

<p>Now I could certainly program all of the behavior myself which would make this a stupid question. But, I'm trying to evaluate products I could use that might help with this task.  My main objective is to allow marketing to modify the look and content of the email, but I'm wondering how much of the logic could I push to them.  If I can let them handle some of the logic then that makes the solution more flexible as the campaigns change.  If I simply handled all logic and let them only handle the email being sent it's a clear division of labor, but that means when they want to tweak the rules I have to go change code.</p>

<p>Currently marketing is using Mailchimp already and I've looked through their API, but it's mostly focused on maintaining email lists which I'm not sure that's the best idea.  I think with Mandrill I can quite simply have a series of templates that I maybe able to choose from and I would direct which template to invoke (simple division of labor case).  After staring at their docs it's not clear if this is the best choice.</p>

<p>So I started to look at others Hubspot, etc.  But I got so tired of reading their marketing speak about a marketing product I wanted to shoot myself.  I just need the straight dope from a technical person about what is the best way to approach this without all of the marketing BS.  I want someone to talk to my situation.  Can anyone give me some guidance on what they did to accomplish this?  What products did you use and how did you use them (ie what is your division of labor in logic vs look)?  How did you use their API to integrate with their product?</p>

I'm building the web apps with AngularJS, vanilla JS &amp; some jQuery. I'm technically only a ""junior"" web developer so my salary is basic (roughly average for a typical front-end dev just coding ""flat"" sites.) Anyway, that explained, I have to work very hard and I'm happy to do so because I'm gaining experience rapidly, learning tonnes and constantly pushed to keep learning which I think is the key to good programming--so I'm fairly happy with the situation. </p>

<p>After a probation period I'm due to get some equity in the company. I was told recently that this will be &lt;0.1% which with a current valuation of &lt; $5M isn't a great deal, and I'm slightly dismayed by it. It's easy to see a massive stock price would need to develop over time to gain any amount handsome enough to start my own ventures with. It's a really good idea and I do believe in it, but let's face it, not many startups go $1B+. It's clear the contribution I need to make to the overall success of the project is certainly significant (to say the least, it'll involve both a business side app to be used by all the implementers and a consumer facing one which is expected to garner a <em>lot</em> of attention.)</p>

<p>So what I'm trying to get is some perspective from those who have experience with this--this is practically my first job, let alone startup environment, and I want to try to gather some realistic expectations and be sure I'm not being unreasonable. I have two questions, really: <strong>does this seem like a reasonable amount of equity given the numbers provided and my responsibilities?

<p>I know a lot of other games do this, and I certainly see that it could be fun, but assuming adding any sort of skin will involve at least <em>some</em> design, development, and testing, not to mention sometimes app updates can cause corruption or bugs in edge cases, is it really worth it?</p>

<p>The way I see it, the main (only?) pro is that it keeps a fun and lively vibe to the game. I guess it also shows users that we're paying attention to them. Maybe there's an advantage that users will see the app update and choose to go into it if they've forgotten about it?</p>

<p>I'm also not sure whether the platform matters. Is there a difference between the iPhone, Android, and Windows Phone versions? Do, for example, Android users respond really well to new skins but iPhone ones don't?</p>

<p>How can I accomplish that general feeling without appearing to favor any religion in particular? The obvious counter-example of what I'm looking for is if I had a Christmas tree in my window, since that would (I assume) favor Christmas over anything else.</p>

<p>My primary goal is simply not to offend anyone. I'd like not to associate with any particular holiday or religion if possible, but if something is on-the-bounds but generally accepted, I'd be okay with that too.</p>

<p>Would it be acceptable for me to put lights up? I've heard that white lights are okay, but other ones make it seem too Christmas-y. That seems pretty sad, since color is a lot more exciting, but I can live with that if need be. What other decorations are universally accepted?</p>

"1682","How can I maintain expectations in my snow plowing business?","<p>I run a small snow plowing business in a rural area. We're close on the threshold between not getting enough snow to warrant the business, and having enough snow that I'd need to expand. For the time being, I'm pretty comfortable with my albeit small fleet of two trucks.</p>

<p>But when it comes to particularly stormy years, or when snow is completely unexpected and comes anyway, how can I manage the expectations of eager customers? This is really just a side-business for me, so I'm not super keen on buying yet another truck to handle these rare occurrences. I don't generally have issues with them getting mad at me, but I always feel bad when they want to get driveways and parking lots clear and my trucks can only move so fast.</p>

<p>What options might I have to manage these expectations and help keep everyone on the same page? How can I convey to them the difficulty of my job and that not every lot can be my very top priority at any given time, while still maintaining a good level of satisfaction?</p>

<p>Again, this is really just an issue in extreme cases where more snow falls than I can handle. It's not a problem most of the time, but when it does happen, it can be frustrating for all involved.</p>

"1683","How can I secure my pumpkin patch in a cost-effective and inviting way?","<p>I run a small pumpkin patch, but as the years go by and we begin to expand, I'm starting to find it difficult to keep up with security. We've had some trouble in the past with vandalism--nothing overly serious, but enough to cost me some money and make me fearful of what else could happen.</p>

<p>How can I secure the farm in such a way that I'll deter any unwanted visitors, but still not scare away potential business?</p>

<p>Obviously I could throw up electric fences with barbed wire, but that hardly fits with the lighthearted fun of picking up a pumpkin. The land is visible from one semi-busy road, so it's not overly secluded.</p>

<p>I generally hire a security company to watch over the place, but that's becoming less and less effective as my land coverage grows. I make enough to pay for the land and maintenance the pumpkins take, but for the eleven months out of the year that people more or less forget about pumpkins, it's hard for me to justify paying the fees of a team of security guards to keep things in order when I'm not around.</p>

<p>I've thought about installing security cameras, but I worry that those might be too much of an investment. And don't I still need someone there constantly monitoring them? I know lots of businesses use fake cameras, or a combination of fake and real ones, but how effective is that really? I've also heard that even just putting up a few cameras and a bunch of ""Secured by <em>[company]</em>"" signs can help significantly without incurring a ton of costs.</p>

"1684","How can I tactfully ask long-term clients to stop expecting freebies from me?","<p>I recently took over ownership of a small restaurant from my parents on their retirement. It's the classic ""they've had it forever"" kind of business and I grew up around it, but business has been stagnant for quite some time now. We're doing okay and I have no complaints, but like any young entrepreneur, I want to see us do <em>fantastically</em>.</p>

<p>I see lots of options opening up to build the business through social networking and event hosting, and I've already begun to do that, but we still have a couple (very welcome!) long-time guests and friends of the family that I'd hate to see go. However, mostly at the hand of my parents, they've developed a system of getting freebies, like drinks and sometimes even food. What started off as a friendly gesture from my father to them (they're friends, which complicates things) has become more of a regular occurrence than I'm really comfortable with.</p>

<p>To be clear, my concerns stretch beyond finances, which I think makes it a bit more difficult. They know that we're doing, well, <em>okay</em>, so it's not as if they're really taking precious pennies from us, but if nothing else I'm worried about the principle. As we enter a new phase of our business, I don't really want to carry the indefinite tradition of giving free food or beverages out to friends.</p>

<p>In general, they're pretty good about it. They certainly hold no malice in taking the food, but every once in a while I have to take a step back and think about that I'm essentially paying meal bills for these people, even if it isn't super commonplace.</p>

<p>How can I begin or conduct a conversation with them that effectively and kindly conveys ""you need to start paying now"" without offending them? Part of my hesitation, I should reiterate, is that they're really <em>my father's friends.</em> They are mine in that I've grown up around them, but I have a hard time viewing them as equals with me. I love having them around, they're definitely fun to talk to, but at the end of the day, they're thirty years my senior and honestly I'm a bit intimidated.</p>

<p>Is this just one of those things that I have to rip the Band-Aid off for? I've thought about approaching my father and having him speak with them, but I'm not sure that would be any less awkward for either of us (I think he probably doesn't see the same problems with offering them the products as I do). Does anyone have any experience with a similar situation, or any tips for going into either of those conversations?</p>

"1685","How can I predict the right number of trees to cut for next year's Christmas tree sales?","<p>I'm thinking of starting a Christmas tree company (I'd be a middle-man between lots and consumers), and I'm trying to plan out my business for next year.</p>

<p>My question is likely--like many--much more easily asked than answered: how can I predict how many trees to cut?</p>

<p>I know this is a big question, and I'm not looking for an exact answer, but mostly I'm curious of what methods I can use to make good estimations. I know similar cases might happen in restaurants, or even perhaps some tech companies that pay for web hosting in advance.</p>

<p>If I take a guess at the answer, I'm thinking the best option would be some statistical analysis of the market (like how many people typically buy trees), but I'm not even sure what I would do with that number. I've thought about asking casually at lots or other resellers, but that seems awkward and potentially offensive (since resellers are my competition).</p>

<p>I don't want to undersell my business here, but ultimately I'm not sure how much value I'm bringing to the table that competitors aren't. I'm not dealing with a startup in the sense of going in on ground-breaking research that changes the world. But by the same token, I don't think my competitors have much advantage over me. It really just comes down to location, which is why I'm starting to wonder whether my best bet might be to look at the relationship of how many trees are sold annually in my area, as well as how much traffic the parking lot I'm looking to set up in actually gets. But are there other variables I should keep in mind?</p>

<p>My branding is fairly limited--I don't run television ads or anything of the sort--and location plays a fairly key role.

<li>They are already aware of the pdf and video files that they need to extract data from.</li>
<li>They have tried other methods such as manual or paying someone.</li>
<li>They have successfully been able to extract data using my SaaS.</li>
</ul>

<p>Now I charge an ""all you can extract"", unlimited plan for my three plans (small, medium, large). The only difference is the number of workers as you go up the plan. The more workers, the faster your overall data extraction.</p>

<p>The price range starts from a few hundred dollars a month to a thousand dollars a month.</p>

<p>I am guessing that the main value from my SaaS comes from saving people lot of manual and time consuming labor. Am I a cost saver?</p>

<p>I am also seeing that the data that is extracted is of value to the customer, but they chose the data they wanted to extract from a resource they already knew ahead of time. Am I a value provider in this case?</p>

<p>If I am a cost saver, then ultimately, is lower monthly plan or higher monthly plan the answer? My competitors charge similar price but they are metered. These folks come to me because of my unlimited plan. The equivalent of hiring a human and paying wages is also unmetered but much more expensive (I assume around $1000 for an intern). Does it make sense to market the time saving features from this angle? ""why hire 5 interns when you can pay ten times less than that with our SaaS"" ?</p>

<p>If I am a value provider, then is a feature based monthly plan the answer? Small plan can only extract PDF. Medium and Large plan can extract Videos. Folks need to segment themselves in to the features they need based on the data they already have that needs to be extracted. The data they chose ahead of time is valuable and they want to extract as much as possible. Marketing vectors from this angle appear difficult because it's hard to know what data they are looking to extract since it's specific to each customers and there is a wide variance on what they find valuable. Some guy wants scientific data because they are a school, some guy wants linguistic data because he's building a service etc.</p>

<p>Thank you.</p>

"1784","Can we just build things we believe it's great first then test the market later, rather than doing the market research first then building things?","<p>I remembered that I read an article somewhere on the internet saying that Steve Jobs just builds things he believe it's great first, then people will understand his products and his ideas later in a hindsight. The article also said that a lot of customers don't know what they want until you said it (it = the thing that they will want) to them.</p>

<p>I think doing market research is only good for common business like restaurant or coffee shop. For these common businesses, you will sell the similar products to others but a bit different. For example, you open a coffee shop (that sells coffee like all other coffee shops) near station because you think people in station will likely to buy coffee and bring them to the trains. For this  coffee shop business, you need to do the market research first to see if the business is viable before you actually start to set up your real coffee shop.</p>

<p>However, I don't think we need too much market research for a Web Startup, because most customers don't know your web idea. The customers need to use your website first, if they like then they will invite other people to use your website.</p>

<p>For a Web Startup, we just build our website first, test it out to see if people like it, then decide to stop it or expand it depending on the customer feedback.</p>

<p>For example, the guy, who made the Flappy Bird, just build thing he believes it's great first then let the players to validate his idea. I don't think he did any kind of market research before building the Flappy Bird. </p>

<p>Other example is that you build a moving vehicle that is completely different from any common vehicle like car, motorbike or bicycle. Your vehicle works like in a science fiction movie. So, apparently, no one knows your new vehicle and how it works until you show it to them right? So, in this case, you just build your vehicle first, then show it to the users. If they like your vehicle then they will tell others to buy yours and you can build up your customer base from that. Of course, you know generally that everyone needs some kind of moving vehicle, but you don't needs to do the market research first before you build your product cos market research makes no sense or useless in this case.</p>

<p>So,</p>

"1794","How to do the advertising handout properly, which does not offend the pedestrians but is very effective?","<p>An advertising handout is a small advertising paper or handbill or leaflet given freely or distributed free to the pedestrians.</p>

<p>Ok, this is what advertising handout people currently do. They stand in the public place like near station or in front of school, then they try to give the handout to everyone who walks through them. Normally, most people don't know what the handout advertises about (it could advertise a restaurant or a fitness club or a church) until they read the handout.</p>

<p>I believe that 95% of people who received the handout in the above situation will either throw away the handout or have never bored to read it. 65% will feel be offended cos someone disturbed them. Many people throw away the handout on the streets / stations.. and make the public places dirty. </p>

<p>I believe that way of doing the handout is quite random and does not target the potential customers very well. Take me for example, I received like 50 handouts in station in 3 years period, but I have never visited any business advertised on the handout. I only read some handouts for a few seconds, and throw away the rest of them.</p>

<p>Then I tried to come up a different way to do the handout that does not offend the pedestrians. That is I will print what is my business about in a rather big paper (maybe 4 times bigger than A4), then I hold that paper in front of me and stand in front of station. When people walk through me, they will read the big text on my big paper and they would know what my advertising about. If they are interested, then they will come to me and ask for info or pick a free small handout leaflet from me. </p>

<p>I believe that way of doing the handout is more effective cos it does not offend the pedestrians. However, that way is not really effective in reality. Actually, I tested that method in real world situation and found that I have too few people come to me. For example, 1/2 hour stood in front of station and there was only 1 person approached to me but she didn't even bore to take my handout leaflet.</p>

<p>I asked myself that why my new solution failed to attract people to take my handout? Maybe people couldn't properly read the text on my big paper? or for some reason I don't know?</p>

<p>So my question is that:</p>

<p>How to do the advertising handout properly that meet the following requirements:</p>

<ul>
<li>does not offend the pedestrians</li>
<li>save resource (waste least handouts)</li>
<li>only give the handout the one who actually interested in my business</li>
<li>keep the public places clean because people will not throw away my handouts on the streets.</li>
<li>100% legal, that means the security people (in the station or in front of schools) will not have any good reason to stop me from advertising my business.</li>
</ul>

<p>I am thinking about a new solution but not sure it is ok. That is I will record a voice message talking about what my business is about into a tape, then carry a cassette reader that can read that tape loudly and stand in public places. I then turn the cassette reader on and people can listen to what my business about and they can come to me to take the handouts if they are interested. But I am not sure if the security people will stop me cos I made the noise. But I could leave the volume small enough to attract only people who walk through me and not attract people who stand far away from me. </p>

<p><strong>Have you tried this solution? does it work?</strong> I saw many advertisers in developing countries doing like that.</p>

"1800","What math or stat models exist that can successfully predict growth potential of a startup?","<p>I know almost nothing about startups and never know how to judge whether my ideas actually merit a serious attempt at a startup.  </p>

<p>I have made several efforts in the past to educate myself about how startups work. However, few resources I have consulted have offered (to me) a convincing method for how to measure/gauge/estimate the growth potential of a startup business. Let me illustrate what I mean through an example.  </p>

<p>Suppose I invent an unusual and desirable way of making pizza. Let's say I have managed to invent a pill that, when water is added, immediately morphs into a fully formed, deep dish, Chicago-style pizza (complete with toppings and already in a box lol). How do I judge whether this product is marketable? Let's suppose I take my pizza pill and sell it around my neighborhood or my city. I thus get a small sample size of what potential my pizza pill has for that cluster of customers. Suppose I also have extracted data on them because I have them use some sort of app or online interface that permits me to monitor certain buying behaviors. But of what value is that data? Can I take data about a local region or small cluster of people and immediately extrapolate to make claims about the growth potential of my business to a much larger sample size? </p>

<p>Perhaps my background as a mathematician and physicist makes me take mathematical claims slightly more literally than others. When I make a claim about what a number represents, I want testable ways of demonstrating that the number means what I say it does. If I am measuring temperature, I don't want to estimate my refrigerator is 50°F and have it be 100°F. My milk, eggs, yogurt, meat --- all of it will spoil. In other words, that means all my resources go to waste. Similarly, if I make an estimate of the number of customers I expect to buy my product, I want to know (within a margin of error) that estimate will actually be accurate. I want to know there is a very high probability (<strong>not a high hope</strong>) that the resources I invest in my venture are going to yield profitable returns. On the flip side, I want to be able to identify when an opportunity <em>won't</em> be profitable so I can save my assets for ones that will be. </p>

<p>To my knowledge, no such method exists. Perhaps it is too idealistic. If that's true, what are the alternatives? Having failed to find info on this myself, I have turned to SE in the hopes someone has ideas about how startups and entrepreneurs approach this problem. </p>

<p>Now, there are people that are exciting about using the app, other that want some really specific features before they want to use it.<br>
An example of the features that some people really expect is the presence of a full user profile. Details for certains (due to the nature of the concept that doesn't really require it, as weird as it sounds), really important for others.</p>

<p><strong>In a ""Buzz""-oriented mind</strong>, should I launch the product right now, and improve it along the way, or should I spent <strong>about one month</strong> to build the feature that some (not the major part) people expect.<br>
Indeed, we all know that nowadays, an app could easily be directly trashed if people don't use them at the very beginning (especially teenagers).<br>

<p>At what point is it reasonable to delay a project for an upcoming release of this nature?</p>

<p>I don't care to get into many details, since this isn't even limited to this release of ASP, or .NET in general, but ultimately this is the next major-version release, and with that, it has a lot of new and exciting cloud features, and some better support for scenarios that I deal with day-to-day.</p>

<p>I figure if I start this project right now on the current version of ASP, I'll be stuck dealing with upgrading soon, and since this is a major release, they aren't promising anything about that to be a clean and easy change. I'll have to upgrade some other software, but it seems a waste to spend what could turn into maybe a few weeks on this, then have to spend another week upgrading. On the other hand, if I wait a few weeks and it doesn't come out, then another few weeks pass, and another, then it would be worth it.</p>

<p>Let see this example, Tom i living in Australia. Tam is living in Thailand. </p>

<p>Tom has AUD in his bank account in Australia.</p>

<p>Tam has Thai Baht in his bank account in Thailand.</p>

<p>Now, Tom wants to go to Thailand &amp; open a business there, so he needs a lot of Thai Baht for his business in Thailand. </p>

<p>Tam wants to go to Australia to study medicine. So he also needs quite a lot of AUD for his study.</p>

<p>OK, If Tom and Tam transfer their money from their own country to oversea, then it will be very costly. They gotta pay for the transferring fee, currency converter. It also takes pretty long time to receive.</p>

<p>SO, here is my solution. I will create a website that helps Tom and Tam to achieve their goals without having to transfer their money internationally. All they do is to login my website. </p>

<p>There will have a list of people who want to do the deals in the website. In this list, each person will say how much money they have in their own country &amp; how much money they want to have in other country.</p>

<p>This is the list:</p>

<pre>
Person - Money Having in that person's Country - Money that person want to have in other country

Tom    - 5000 AUD                              - 100000 Thai Baht
Tam    - 100000 Thai Baht                      - 5000 AUD
</pre>  

<p>So now Tom and Tam saw the list and they can do the deal. Tom already arrived in Thailand &amp; open a Thai bank account there &amp; Tam already arrived in Australia and open an Australian bank account there.</p>

<p>Then Tom has 5000 AUD in Australian bank account &amp; Tam has 100000 Thai Baht in Thai bank account.</p>

<p>Tom does the online banking and transfer 5000 AUD from his  Australian bank account to Tam's Australian bank account.</p>

<p>Tam does the online banking and transfer 100000 Thai Baht from his Thai bank account to Tom's Thai bank account.</p>

<p>Suppose that 5000AUD=100000 Thai baht (using the current exchange rate).</p>

<p>So by doing that they just need locally rather than internationally  transfer their money.</p>

<p>Common reasons include their supervisor is stingy, they are able to use teams in India etc.</p>

<p>My software has already saved thousands of man hours for customers who are paying the full price, and for these folks they don't seem to object to the price, rather they understand that the software saves them time. </p>

<p>How do I respond to these price objectors who demand a whopping 86% in discount, yet interestingly enough they are the MOST demanding when it comes to support and feature requests.</p>

<p>""Oh but I can get someone in India doing it for $2/hr to do it for me""</p>

<p>Are these people simply not a right fit? Should I drop them? IF so, how would I tell them that they might not be a good fit in a polite way?</p>

<p>OR is does this signal a poor market-fit of the product and the price needs to drop? </p>

<p>I just don't understand why the current customers paying the full price are so happy while the new prospects seem very stingy and selective, even after claiming they see the value and the time it will save them.</p>

<p>If saving 100s of hours is worth very little to someone, doesn't it mean that their time is probably worth very little? Where as someone who's time is worth a lot (executives, managers) saving 100 of hours would pay off greatly? </p>

"3008","Developers joining startup","<p>We are 2 developers currently looking to join a  startup. The existing product let's call it marketplace for the sake of this discussion. The first marketplace they launched had a medioker year. It was also rediculously expensive, as it was developed by a web agency. After the first year there was little to no succes and lets say 50-60K invested to 0 profit.
(Budgets were spent wrong, money was spent wrong, things went wrong generally...)</p>

<p>At this very moment the original founder is still active in the project. 2/4 off the original founders no longer actively ""work"" for the project. They no longer want to actively participate but don't want to quit either. I don't blame them, we are trying to make this company grow, why would they just give up their shares in the middle of growth?</p>

<p>At this point we enter a company that is on the hinge of extinction. We make the very foolish decision to develop and overhaul the entire platform before an investor is found. In the hope that the new platform would look more professional and appealing to investors. To great pleasure to the current stakeholders (who are no longer active in the project) we have now successfully launched the new marketplace but are actually still negotiating terms (shares and equity). No investor has been found to date.</p>

<p>At this point we are discussing with the owner and one of his active partners weither we are not better off ending the old company and creating a new one. Hence we are creating a lot of additional value. And are also working on some offspring idea's. On which we would have to share profits with the other stakeholders.</p>

<p>We feel like we have an enormous responsibility and drive to make this company grow. Our tasks vary from active support to marketing, designing and developing and maintaining the project as well as account for hosting and maintenance of the entire project.</p>

<p>The current prospect for us is to get 8% of the shares vested within this year. And another 4% over the coming 2-3 years based on objectives and the active work we do.</p>

<p>I feel like the idea's we are contributing and the work we are putting into this project exceed the amount of shares we are currently being ""handed"". </p>

<p>What are good arrangements that are both good for the owner of this project, as well as us the new spirits!
Should we dump the old company and it's name for the sake of it? We currently still have a moderate userbase.
Can we create new shares to create an exit for the old shareholders?
What should our strategy be?</p>

<p>UPDATE
We've had our meeting but I must say it was quite hectic. They litterally said creating the new company was not an option as there was already 80-90K invested as well as a lot of time. (I understand this but wasting all the money(80 to 90k), creating a company with little  turnaround We've had our meeting but I must say it was quite hectic. They litterally said creating the new company was not an option as there was already 80-90K invested as well as a lot of time. Also they were of the opinion they did create a certain name for themselves as well as a decent platform with a steady userbase ( after 1 year 70% of the users are no longer active) aswell as it wouldn't be fair to the other 2 passive Shareholders. </p>

<p>Our current new proposal is to have 15% of the shares upfront as we will be creating and executing the 2nd more valuable concept later this year. We will be creating value from the moment it's launched. Another 10 to 15 over the course of 3 years. Ex 6,666 / y</p>

<p>Then we would want a financial saying (voting rights) for budgets spent higher then 6000 USD.  </p>

<p>Some concerns are that the person with the idea holds more then 51% off al shares and is planning to invest/trade his own money in company for newly created equity. 
He has a veto over every decision. We do not want to see another year where money is not spent well. 
My colleauge is at the point where he doubts we could continue like this. We already have an exit strategy involving handing over the code and guaranteeing any bugfixes within a month in exchange for golden handshake.</p>

<p>my biggest concern is not to end up screwed here. </p>

<p>Some arguments we want to use. The old userbase is worth little. The old platform is far worse then the new but cost them 40k. Also none of its code has been reused. We literally only use the old data and users (which are kinda stale in my opninion).  So our contribution should rate higher or at least equal? maybe 3k in a year.

Currently I have a 30-day trial (w/o CC number) setup but for high touch clients this is almost unnecessary since I usually close them on the first phone call after demoing the product and demonstrating value.</p>

<p>The people that won't talk to me on the phone, usually ask for a huge discount, request ridiculous things so I am thinking of getting rid of the trial altogether as they appear to be the wrong market fit.</p>

<p>What can I replace the free trial with?</p>

<p>I am thinking of creating a form that will ask their phone number. In overwhelming amount of cases, someone who doesn't provide a phone number usually isn't very serious about buying or is not the right target. However, I am aware that some people might not want to input their phone number.</p>

"3045","Using An Entity To Setup Business/Assets While Maintaining Some Privacy","<p>I am wondering what the correct entity, if one exists, that should be formed in order to create an online business and register all of the required servcies, while still maintaining some piece of privacy. I am not looking to fool anybody, and I intend on being reachable via legal channels if necessary, but I don't want all of my information going into a bunch of databases and having someone show up at my front door. I would like some layer between my business and myself... as thick a layer as possible. I must be able to maintain legal control over the busines and its assets, while not having to use my personal information for everything. Basically, I want to have my cake and eat it too.  </p>

<p>So far, my question has led me to think that the best option is forming some sort of corporate entity in order to obtain an EIN, to use in place of a SSN, and use the corporate entity information in place of my personal information. I will need to perform the following tasks with this entity:</p>

<ol>
<li>Register A Domain Name</li>
<li>Setup Credit Card Payment Processing</li>
<li>Setup Merchant Account</li>
<li>Register PO Box</li>
<li>Register Phone Service</li>
</ol>

<p><br>Getting a payment processor seems like it will the biggest challenge... The highly recommended STRIPE TOS almost made me vomit:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>To verify your identity, we will require additional information including your  business EIN or Tax ID, social security number, and
  date of birth.</strong> We may also ask  for additional information to help
  verify your identity and assess your business risk  including business
  invoices, a driver’s license or other government issued 
  identification, or a business license. We may ask you for financial
  statements. We may request for your permission to do a physical
  inspection at your place of business and  to examine books and records
  that pertain to your compliance with this Agreement. Your  failure to
  comply with any of these requests within five (5) days may result in 
  suspension or termination of your Stripe Account.</p>
  
  <p><strong>...After we have collected and verified all your information, Stripe will review your account and determine if you are eligible to use the
  Service. Stripe may also share  your information with our payment
  processors (such as Wells Fargo), each of which may  also make a
  determination regarding your eligibility.</strong> We will notify you once
  your  account has been either approved or deemed ineligible for use of
  the Service.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, I'm handing over all of my data and it may very well be all for nothing. Also, I'm handing over my personal information to whomever STRIPE pleases.
<br><br></p>

<p><strong>EDIT 1:</strong></p>

<p>I get the feeling some of the answers reflect a perception that my goal is to be anonymous.  I know this sounds suspicious, but this is not the case for two very good reasons: if it were, I would not be able to legally claim my assets nor would I be able to legally claim money due to my business in court. That being said, the point of this is that my personal address does not show up in any records... I don't see why this can't be possible. PO Boxes and most Commercial Mail Receving Agencies (CMRA) cannot be used to register services, so the biggest problem for a non-brick'n'mortar shop, a small online business for example, is that the address of the company is their home. Perhaps I should have asked how to register a business and services without using a personal address, but the larger question includes the SSN which is required on a lot of applications these days. Why can't I seem to find a way to register a domain, phone, etc. as:</p>

<pre><code>BUSIENSS ABC
BUSINESS ID
BUSINESS ADDRESS
</code></pre>

<p>instead of</p>

<pre><code>MY NAME
MY SSN
MY PERSONAL ADDRESS
</code></pre>

<p>???</p>

<p>... also, not to push my luck, but an order of events is important here so that something needed for Step 1 is not achieved until Step 2. Example: Non-personal mailing address -> Self-Proprietorship -> Domain Registration.</p>

<p>As for notions of paranoia, I don't think its unfair for me to deal with my potential clients from behind a counter as opposed to at my front door. Unlikely as it seems that someone would show up on my doorstep, bad things like that happen all the time (if you read the news). And sure, if someone wants to find you then they will eventually find you, but it defies reason not to take a few precautions.</p>

It is possible to obtain an EIN to use instead of an SSN, and I'm wondering what the advantage (or disadvantages) may be of doing this. I can think of several benefits:</p>

<ol>
<li>If an EIN is stolen, they can impersonate or ruin your business but not your personal life. (Obviously, Business = Life, but I think you know what I mean).</li>
<li>A new SSN is notoriously difficult to replace, while an EIN is not as difficult.</li>
<li>An EIN may be required by some manufacturers/distributors to obtain business-class products and discounts.</li>
</ol>

<p>Disadvantages:</p>

<ol>
<li>The business may be taxed differently.</li>
</ol>

<p>Are these statements true, and do you have any others you can think of?</p>

<p>Recently, I hired a freelance developer to do some front-end updates on my e-commerce website. Because of the nature of e-commerce websites, I care a lot about showing up in search results and having fast page loads.</p>

<p>I'm pretty happy with the result so far, but I have no idea whether my developer has coded well, or if they have any talent or skill at it.

"3130","How to search for developer for app collaboration","<p>Last summer I came up with an idea for an app game. I decided to develop it myself so (coming from Java) started to learn objective-C and programs such as Xcode. During the summer I wrote a functioning pre-alpha version of the app (lacking artwork) but I was unable to finish it before the holidays ended (I've written about 50% of what in my eyes could be considered as the first version of the final app).</p>

<p>Currently I am working on a new project and since this new project falls better into my fields of interest (finance, trading), I've given up on the app.</p>

<p>But I would love to finish it as IMHO I think it could be a huge success. Therefore I've decided to search for a developer which is willing to finish (or rewrite) the app and split the profits. This means that I'm not willing to invest any money into it. Rather I would like to split profits 60/40 (60 for the developer).</p>

<p>I have a few questions regarding this:</p>

<ul>
<li>Is this a fair profit sharing ratio?</li>
<li>How and where should I search for developers?</li>
</ul>

<p>Especially the second question left me clueless: posting an 'ad' on a big site could result in some sort of adverse selection of developers. Likewise, I think that approaching individual developers that are both good and motivated could be rather difficult: should I target professionals, student-developers, freelancers, amateurs? I would like to have a local developer (for 1-to-1 meetings) but I also want the developer to be <em>skilled</em> (in developing apps/designing artwork) and <em>highly motivated</em>/<em>enthusiastic</em>, so with such a geographic restriction it might be hard to find one.</p>

Now, I assume you could quite easily demand the money back for the job itself, but could you also sue him for the extra costs you had due to this (either the cost of settling with the copyright holder of the asset or paying for the cost of the 1000 copies and the cost of putting them up and taking them down prematurely)? The reason I am asking mostly is to know to which extend we should go to check work or whether that falls outside our responsibility.</p>

"3241","Acquiring the competition","<p>First, a brief history:</p>

<p>About five years ago, I created an online game to rival an existing game - it used the same core mechanic, but everything else branched from there in a different direction. For most of the creation time, I followed the principle of ""learn from their mistakes"", and as a result we are now significantly more liked than the rival. Everything from Alexa rank through general site activity to ongoing development is at least an order of magnitude greater.</p>

<p>However, there is one thing they still have over us: more users. Having been around for longer, this is practically a given, but it didn't help that we went through a massive reboot last year, essentially purging out all the inactive users. As it stands, we have about 30,000 users, to their 140,000. Not bad, considering we barely advertise and it's all through word-of-mouth!</p>

<p>At this point, their site is faltering - the owners/developers are increasingly busy with ""real life"" (whereas I've made my project <em>be</em> my ""real life"") and their features have stagnated - they haven't been keeping up with new releases of the source material that both our games are founded on, for instance, and more recently they had to put out a feature that is a very thinly-veiled ""we don't have time for this, here's the stuff"".</p>

<p>The reason I bring all this up is because there are some features of theirs that are particularly good, and that I'd really like to have on my own game, but am wary of doing so because of past accusations that we are ""ripping off"" their site. Which, in all honesty, we kind of are; we're just doing it right. The point is, I fear backlash if I just outright steal the features. Which is why I'm considering the idea of acquisition.</p>

<p>It's kind of a scary prospect to me. Until more recently, this has just been a rivalry as we drive each other to do better, but now that we're blazing ahead I'm afraid to lose what I've built. I don't want to make any false moves. It doesn't help that I was 17 at the time this whole thing started, and correspondingly stupid - I did what a lot of teens do on the internet, and any friendly bridges between myself and the other site have long been burned.</p>

<p>I'm wondering if I could get any advice regarding how to go about contacting them with the idea of buying their site, especially considering that my intention would be to migrate the features I want, and the users, over to my version of the game and close theirs down... I want to ensure I go about this in a professional manner, and one that hopefully leads to ongoing success.</p>

"3266","Is there a way to distribute money to 3rd parties directly from customers w/o incurring 2x fees?","<p>Say for example, a non-profit corporation of 4 members needs to pay their electric bill ($10), rent ($10), and water bill ($10) for the month. They need to send out a bill of $7.50 to each member. Each member pays the $7.50 bill with their credit card to the corporation. Then the corporation pays to the utility companies each $10.</p>

<p>If this were done with credit cards, then each transaction would be almost instantaneous but would incur large charges from member->corp, then corp->3rd party (essentially taking 2x merchant fees).  </p>

<p>If this were done with ACH, then each transaction would be cheaper so 2x fees is less important but the transactions take 1-3 days which would mean less time before the 3rd parties get paid.</p>

"3351","Should I get a job before I start my business?","<p>To make a long story short, I'm in a PhD program that I'm not very happy with.  I've been in school for too long, I'm restless, and I've decided that publishing inane papers in today's ""publish or perish"" academic climate is not the way for me to make an impact on the world.  I've given up my romantic notions of the ""life of the mind.""</p>

<p>Rather than posting another rant on Academia SE, I thought I'd start with my goal (a successful startup), and go from there.  </p>

<h1>Here's the situation</h1>

<ul>
<li>I'm 30 and I've spent nearly my entire life in school.  I'm tired of academia.</li>
<li>I have a lot of ideas for products, a solid technical education background (engineering undergrad and master's degrees), and a good amount of experience with software development.</li>
<li>I really don't want to spend my life working to make someone else rich.  I've already worked too hard and I'm willing to take the risks involved in working for myself.</li>
<li>I've already built a successful local business in the two years that I've been in this town.</li>
</ul>

<h1>But...</h1>

<ul>
<li>I don't have a huge amount of savings that I could live off of for a while.</li>
<li>As uninterested as I've become, my PhD program is still a job.  They pay me a livable stipend, and I get health care and access to University resources.</li>
<li>My local business, while successful, is more of a side income.  I doubt I could live off of it.</li>
<li>While <strong>I have the ideas and the technical skills, I don't have the connections</strong>.  I need people to bounce ideas around with, specifically people who are ""in the loop"" when it comes to the consumer market landscape.  I get feedback on my ideas like ""oh that sounds cool"", or ""oh that's dumb"".  I need something more before I throw my energy into building a product/website/whatever.</li>
</ul>

<h1>So, my question is...</h1>

<ul>
<li><strong>Should I get a job?</strong>  Maybe working for a successful startup will help me <strong>make the connections I need</strong>, or at least learn more about the ""unsolved problems"" in a particular domain.  I might also be able to <strong>save enough money to support myself</strong> while I explore some of my ideas.</li>
<li>Should I try to get a job in Silicon Valley?  I'm in the Midwest, at the moment.  Maybe if I move closer to where the action is, I'll meet more people.  Then again, it's expensive to live there...</li>
<li>Or, should I try to expand my side business into a full-time thing?  It's working well so far, but I'm not confident that it's scalable.</li>
<li>Freelance/consult?  Between that and my business, I might be able to scrape by.  But it probably won't leave me a whole lot of time to work on my own projects.</li>

"3356","Psychology of pricing structures and best practice","<p>I am a new family photographer and getting the pricing structure right is a big part of my business and something that is always on my mind.</p>

<p>I am constantly worried about the way I have listed my prices because I have a lot of drop-off's from the pricing page on my website.</p>

<p>I receive about 400 visitors a month to my site and it is this page where most visitors leave after seeing it, some return a bit later but usually don't come back.</p>

<p>There are two main types of charging for this service in my area: 1) low session fee, high price products (usually sold during a viewing session) 2) high price session fee, lower priced products</p>

<p>I am using the second method but have developed packages (bronze, silver and gold) to give clients an idea of what they will receive for their money. I am always worried though that the prices are perceived as being too high and that may be the reason they're leaving this page. </p>

<p>I always want my clients to be absolutely clear as to what my prices are before booking a session and I have thought of a way I might be able to alter the pricing strategy slightly without adjusting my prices or deceiving people. I usually take a booking deposit of £40 and some people like to choose their package after viewing the photos so I am considering doing this for all clients. The booking fee will become a session fee which I will discount from all of my packages and offer the packages as ""extra value packages"" that they can choose following their session, as well as being able to simply order prints or digitals away from a package.</p>

<p>This could benefit in a couple of ways that I can think of 1) it splits the payment down into two chunks which may be appealing 2) the perceived upfront cost is lower (although I will still list all the other prices). I am worried though about it becoming confusing if not done right.</p>

<p>I am no expert on this kind of thing but basically I am looking to direct more people to call or book after viewing the prices rather than just leaving the site. </p>

<p>My question is: What is visually the most enticing pricing method to get more conversions, other than simply lowering the prices. Are people more keen to buy when they see the cost broken down somewhat?</p>

<p>Let's assume that I want to create a company with core skills I don't have.

<p>On the other side startups should focus on learning what features the customers need and ship as fast as possible, iterating as much as possible.</p>

<p>I have a few ideas how to market to my target audience and hope that they will follow me, but I think it's also important to simply gain followers in general even if they are not my target audience for 2 reasons - first I think people are more likely to follow someone if they already have a lot of followers, and second because it will improve my search results.</p>

<p>Anyone know of a group like this, and if not, want to start one with me?  </p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>  </p>

<p>I think this is a very important step for new startups so I'm going to add what I've learned.  Please  add comments if you disagree with any of these findings.</p>

<p><strong>Facebook</strong> - Grow user base through direct marketing to customers.  Do not promote anything.  Do not pay to get more followers.  If the business is located locally and will not have any international targets, block access from many developing countries to prevent likes from unengaged followers.</p>

<p><strong>Google+</strong> - Google blocks automatic posts from other sources so many people use this as their base for posting messages.  Use this to post directly to Facebook, Linkedin, Twitter, and other sites of they apply.</p>

<p><strong>Twitter</strong> - Growing user base is important.  Find any and all relevant users that tweet a lot and follow them.  Ask some to visit your site in hopes of having them follow you.  User base count is important but undetermined if it's worthwhile to pay for followers.  Probably not worth much.</p>

<p><strong>Pinterest</strong> - If you have images that you want customers to look at again which relates to selling your merchandise/branding, allow users to Pin images from your site to Pinterest.  Have your own Pinterest page with all important images from your site in appropriate categories.  This can be a burden to maintain so do not overdo it.</p>

<p><strong>LinkedIn</strong> - Not just for a company page.  Page must first start from employee which means the company page revolves around an individual first and that individual's page matters more initially.  Make sure you have joined several groups and have followers so that when you add your corporate page, others will see it and you can promote it.</p>

<p><strong>Instagram</strong> - Main social media site for the younger crowd.  Do not post images alone.  Add text, #, and @ similar to twitter.  May as well post same message to Twitter as Instagram.  User base count here matters and people tend to have almost 2x as many followers here than on Twitter.</p>

"3440","Taking a ridesharing idea from concept to market","<p>I have an idea for a ridesharing app that would connect passengers and taxi service operators that works as follows:</p>

<ol>
<li>Users would book a taxi on the ridesharing app </li>
<li>If a user wants to share their journey, then the app will automatically search for a potential co-passenger travelling in a similar direction</li>
<li>Once done the bookings would be uploaded onto a auction system on which service operators can then bid for them</li>
</ol>

<p>In addition, taxi service operators have access to the auction system (which they pay a monthly subscription for - and this is how the business makes money), on which they can not only just bid for jobs but also post jobs (for example, if they are busy and cannot fulfill the booking) and trade jobs. So the idea is basically a universal mobile booking standard for taxi companies and customers. <a href=""http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/politics/chi-centralized-taxi-dispatch-system-20140930-story.html"" rel=""nofollow"">Admittedly, we are not the first people in the world to come up with this idea</a>.</p>

<p>The problem I now have is bringing this idea to market. It is relatively easy to develop, but I am worried about getting the execution all wrong. So far I am seeing a few areas of concern:</p>

<ul>
<li>The idea has already been done, and larger companies have revenue, infrastructure and a proven model. I am somewhat behind the curve.</li>
<li>Cab sharing is not ideal with women. The idea raises big moral issues with single women.</li>
<li>How on earth are we going to afford the marketing and advertising budget to get taxi service on board? We have no idea of how to calculate the actual cost of getting an reasonable uptake of this kind of service in a new area?</li>
<li>Furthermore, trying to launch this concept to the public leaves me with a chicken and egg scenario. Suppliers will not sign up to the service unless you can say you have a volume of customers wanting to use the service. Customers will not use the service unless you have a number of active suppliers engaged and willing to offer cabbing services. To launch the service therefore requires a timely bringing together of the two entities, which is a marketing and advertising campaign, or I either run the service for free or a massive discount for a month to get people using the service.</li>
<li>All taxi service operators have their own system already of assigning jobs, so this is another barrier to entry. How would we convince them to make the switch?</li>
</ul>

<p>Can anyone suggest how to best tackle this issues? I'd be ever so grateful.</p>

<p>I set up a <a href=""http://bloomingtontutors.com/feedback"" rel=""nofollow"">feedback page</a>, and of course we are on Yelp, Google+, etc.  But we get very little spontaneous feedback or reviews from customers.  We tried emailing customers last semester after midterms, explicitly asking them to leave feedback on our feedback page.  Unfortunately, we got a very low response rate (about 6%).  </p>

<p>The way I see it, I have a couple strategies for timing:</p>

<ol>
<li>Ask each client after their first session.  This might mesh well with the fact that customers are probably trying to decide how they feel about us immediately after the first session, rather than the 5th, 10th, or 20th.  On the other hand, one session is hardly a good ""sample size"" for someone to form an opinion.</li>
<li>Ask everyone after midterms (this didn't seem to work so well).</li>
<li>Ask everyone before finals (untested).  At this point, clients have had plenty of time to get to know us, but they haven't skipped town for winter/summer break.</li>
<li>Ask everyone after finals.  I strongly dislike this idea, because most clients will be eager to leave school and school-related things behind.</li>
</ol>

<p>I could also ask clients at multiple points in the semester, and perhaps set up something to automatically email them after the 1st, 5th, 10th sessions.  But, I don't want my customers to feel nagged.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You need someone to set a North star for you about where the company wants to go<br>
  [...]<br>
  So for operating for growth, what you really need to think about, is <strong>what is the North star of your company</strong>: What is that one metric, where if everyone in your company is thinking about it and driving their product towards that metric and their actions towards moving that metric up, you know in the long-run your company will be successful.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He also gives a number of example North stars of companies:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You'd see you <em>registered user</em> numbers for MySpace, [...]<br>
    Mark [Zuckerberg (Facebook)] put out <em>monthly active users</em>, [...]<br>
    If you’re a messaging application, <em>sends</em> is probably the single most important number. [...]<br>
    Inside Airbnb, they talk about <em>‘nights booked’</em> [...]<br>
    For eBay, it was <em>gross merchandise volume</em>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Citations from the <a href=""http://startupclass.samaltman.com/courses/lec06/"" rel=""nofollow"">transcript</a>, emphasis added by me.</p>

<p>As the whole class is primarily about software startups, these examples are also in this field. But what would be a great North star for a company selling hardware products?</p>

<p>Of course, the <em>number of sold units per time interval</em> suggests itself, but is it actually a good metric? Compared to social networks this is more like a counterpart to <em>registered users</em> and less like <em>monthly active users</em> and thus ignores everything except the fact that the device was sold. So this may be too simple.</p>

<p>Looking at Apple for example, besides the number of sold devices, they also talk about <em>customer satisfaction rates</em>. This addresses the time after the purchase, but is not sufficient to measure growth.</p>

<p>Thus the question: <strong>What would be a great North star for a company selling hardware products?</strong></p>

<hr>

<p>As different types of companies obviously have different North stars, I am particularly interested in the case where a single customer will usually not buy more than one unit over a few years (maybe skateboards or in-line skates or things where the buying pattern is similar).</p>

"3482","How much equity are companies offering nowadays?","<p>I'm on the prowl for a new job and am expecting several offers in the coming weeks (hence the throaway).  I'd like to get a firm grasp on what to expect for equity.  My role would be senior engineer, tech lead, or engineering manager.  I'm currently a top performer at a well-known start-up, have a good resume, and interview really well.</p>

<p>Besides some limited feedback from peers, most of what I have to go off regarding equity is here:</p>

<p><a href=""https://www.wealthfront.com/tools/startup-salary-equity-compensation"">https://www.wealthfront.com/tools/startup-salary-equity-compensation</a></p>

<p>Unfortunately this data is segmented by company size as opposed to company valuation (or FMV) at the time of grant.  Ideally, I'd like to get some idea of what a good ""dollar value"" equity offering might be, if you compute ""dollar value"" as:</p>

<pre><code>dollar value = #options (in basis points) * current best valuation (_not_ FMV)
</code></pre>

<p>For example, 50,000 options out of 100,000,000 total issued would be 5 basis points.  If the company's current valuation (<em>not FMV</em>) is $150m, that'd be $75,000 in ""dollar value"".  I think putting options in these terms makes the most sense, as it becomes easy to value them against the company's growth.  In the above case, if the company quadruples, I stand to gain about 4 x $75,000 (minus price to exercise).  I'm very familiar with how options work, FMV vs actual valuation, strike price, vesting, etc... no help needed there.</p>

<p>Just looking for some data points about how much ""dollar value"" in equity companies are offering, and can be negotiated for, nowadays.  For example, how many RSUs are Google and FB giving out?  How about start-ups?  How much will it vary with company stage (seems like it should remain roughly constant)?</p>

"3487","Seed funding term sheets : YC Safe vs SeedSummit docs","<p>I am raising seed from an Advisors.</p>

<p>He is more a ""Friend and Family"" than an ""unknown greedy VC of doom""</p>

<p>I am wondering what are the key differences between the <a href=""http://www.ycombinator.com/safe"" rel=""nofollow"">YC Safe term sheet</a>
and the <a href=""http://www.seriesseed.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">Series Seed - Stock Investment Agreement</a></p>

<p>In my particular case, we have already agreed on a number of shares, and I don't need to give too many special rights. I am really looking for a founder friendly term sheet.</p>

<p>I live in (and love) Hong Kong, but we'll incorporate in Delaware</p>

<p>I think a real point to point comparison might be useful to more people than specific advices in my case.</p>

<p>In your answer please state if you are an entrepreneur or VC</p>

<p>From my own research, here is what I found :</p>

<ul>
<li>The Safe is much easier to understand. Three options : Cap no Discount (Give a percentage for a given price), No Cap but discount (Ensure he will have a X time return on investment), Cap or Discount (Ensure he will have the best between X% shares or a Y time return on investment.</li>
<li>The Seedsummit document pre-negociates some term for the preferred stock. Like the number of board members. The safe will just assume that those terms will be negotiated later during the A round.</li>
<li>Seedsummit seems much more investor friendly, as stated in their <a href=""http://www.seriesseed.com/posts/2010/09/version-20-and-why-series-seed-documents-are-better-than-capped-convertible-notes.html"" rel=""nofollow"">own blog</a> : </li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>To clarify, there is no question that as an entrepreneur you would prefer uncapped convertible debt to equity.  As Josh and many others point out, this is typically not a fair deal for the investors and many investors won’t do it, or will only do it for people that they are blindly in love with. </p>

"3516","Why early employee equity is low?","<p>I understand that there is no clear cut answer here.</p>

<p>Based on everything I read most of early employees (let say employees #5-#10) are granted maximum 1-2% of equity. Even this is quite extraordinary (something like that is granted for very senior people). </p>

<p>I do the math and getting following. In the bad case, the equity worth zero (so it's not interesting to discuss and calculate). Let's go over positive case. Taking into account that equity is granted early it will be diluted in round A,B,C...). Let say, it will be diluted twice.</p>

<p>As result, this early employee will be having let say 0.5% of a company. Let say the company exits for $100M (which is nice exit). The employee will get $0.5M before tax. And this is spread over 4 years, which means additional $120k pretax a year.</p>

<p>Sure. It's not something to sneeze at. However, it's not a game changer (a person won't be able to retire or anything like that). And taking into account that we were talking about senior people, they can go to some public company with nice package (higher salary and options which an be sold) and zero risk and achieve something comparable or they can go to pre-IPO, round D-E company, get let say 0.05% and get similar outcome with way higher probability.</p>

<p>My question is. Why the industry end up with such numbers? They look a little bit low. Surely, it works unbelievably great for once in a decade companies (Google, Facebook, Microsoft). It works great even for once a year company (as example Splunk, FireEye). However, the math doesn't well for good (but not great exits).</p>

"3546","What's the difference between success and failure?","<p>It may sound a silly question...but listen to my story.</p>

<p>I'm 24 years old. In 2013 I started a small startup in Italy, my country, one of the most corrupted, messed up and stupid countries nowadays. I did it here because I had the opportunity to do it and I couldn't imagine things could get worse than 2013 in Italy...</p>

<p><strong>THE STARTUP</strong></p>

<ol>
<li><p>The startup involves Motorsport, a very small niche with small
earnings prospect (I knew it and I didn't care because it's my passion and I love my job).</p></li>
<li><p>In this startup there is me (CEO and 100% worker), an investor (who
gave me 10K + the kickoff I needed + precious help during all our
adventure) and many freelance who work with us when necessary
(around 10 ppl).</p></li>
<li><p>Since 2008, this industry lost around 70-80% of customers. That's
why I invested! Hoping for a recovery.</p></li>
</ol>

<p><strong>THE SITUATION AFTER 2 YEARS</strong></p>

<p>The startup grew! (keep in mind that in Italy we are broke and 80% of people live with 1.2K per month) The first year I earned nothing but lost nothing, the second year I got like 1.5K per month and this year I can get to 2.5K net per month. After this year, me and my investor we will both recover the investment and start earning for real. Get ready for ridiculousness now:</p>

<ol>
<li>I can't expand. In my current tax regime (which consists in not exceeding a certain revenue) I pay 30% tax. The next step is around 75% (not joking) So, if I want to grow my business and get more customers, if I collect 150K I earn exactly like if I earn 55K. Why should I work twice to earn less? At what risk?</li>
<li>I can't move my fiscal domicile, because sales are done phisically here, hence I must pay taxes here.</li>
<li>I can't move my startup, because being motorsport a tiny niche, either you are big or you must know everyone and, hence, start from scratch your escalade.</li>
<li>I can't get big investments to explode (like in USA) because bureaucracy here is slower than a sloth, no funds are available and nobody sane would invest here.</li>
<li>Risks are too high because here (no joking again) being politicians all scammers, laws are made to defend scammers. For instance, you can live 2 years without paying rent before the owner is able to kick you out. Also, if somebody doesn't pay for your job it takes at least 10 years to end the trial. So there is a concrete risk that i work hard to get nothing.</li>
<li>I can't get employees, because for a 10K salary you actually pay 30K and once you get them you can't fire them for your whole life, without losing money and resources. Hence, many employees tend to get soft after years...</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>HERE COMES THE PARADOX</strong></p>

<p>I always thought success is when you build something that gives you profit. I thought success is when after X time you have more money than you had at the beginning. And here I am!</p>

<p>But I can't define my adventure as successful...With my degree I can start work tomorrow for 100K year in Switzerland and I can't imagine spending my life slowly drowning in this sea of ridiculousness, where I can't legally grow my business and as a ""successful"" entrepreneur I can't even buy a house. I can't move. I can't grow. I can't trust. I don't even know if I can sell my business.</p>

<p>I have a few questions regarding setting up the business entity for us to trade with. We are basically looking for the simplest, and cheapest legal structure to allow us to invest our money together. </p>

<ul>
<li><strong>What business entity should we establish?</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>So we are going to fall under a loose distinction of a hedge fund, but we are different than normal hedge funds in that we are not investing money for other people. The ""fund"" will simply be money from my partner and I. From some research I have learned that most hedge funds are typically two parts: an LP and an LLC, where the LP represents the fund and the LLC represents the fund manager. Because we are not taking money from a fund, can we simply use an LLC and call it good?</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Can we establish the business in a state other than that we live in?</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>From what I understand, you have to register your business in the state that it does business in. But as a company that strictly deals in securities, although we are based out of Illinois where we live, we don't really do business here, or anywhere for that matter. It is all done over the internet. Are we allowed to establish our business through an agent to a more business suitable state like Nevada or Wyoming? Illinois charges $600 to file an LLC, more than we want to pay. </p>

Although from the programming standpoint I know I can do it (the only thing is that working alone will take a little more time to finish it), I don't know if it is feasible to launch such an app alone.</p>

<p>I know there are lots of concerns like: marketing to sell the product, the bureaucracy involved, there should also be tutorials for people to learn to use the app, and also it's necessary to manage the finances. This is just a short list that I could think right now about it. Looking at this from the standpoint of a developer is a little daunting.</p>

<p>So my question is: is it feasible to launch one app alone? If it is, how can it be done? I mean, which guidelines I could follow so that I simplify those things until the app grows enough so that more people can be hired?</p>

"3668","Is it waste of time invest in some domain that already has apps?","<p>Lately I've seem much emphasis on the development of cloud applications with several clients (web desktop, mobile, etc) and that can even in some more sophisticated cases interface with another devices in order to control them (the internet of things). I've been preparing to build one of these, but it gets complicated to select which app to build.</p>

<p>The problem is, many of the ideas I thought about, I go google about it, and there is already at least one app to achieve that goal I had in mind and this makes life really complicated. </p>

<p>One of the examples I searched, there were in my country 550 thousand companies of the segment that could be potential customers of the app, and in my city there were 1500 companies. In that case, selling for 500 which I think is already a big number, but it still represents just 0,09% of the national market share and 0,27% of the city market share. Those are small numbers from my point of view.</p>

<p>So my question is: if I have the idea to develop some app to accomplish some goal, is it <strong>always</strong> a waste of time when there are another apps lurking around or in cases where there are tons of customers available, like the numbers I gave, it becomes possible to have success even though there are already apps in place?</p>

<p>My point of view is that since there is some app already, I'll have a hard time with marketing. The reason is because the app will have less impact, since it won't be something new for the customers. Is that right?</p>

"3682","How should I account for waste?","<p>In a small (hobby stage) business, how should I account for waste?</p>

<p>I'm buying my raw materials (fine lumber and other stuff) under a sales tax exemption (state of Texas, Travis county 8.25% total rate.) So I have to account for how it's used (sales are taxable, disposed of is not taxable, other uses become taxable.)</p>

<p>I'm trying to do accrual accounting, where I take material off the inventory account at cost and move it to finished goods.</p>

<p>However, there is a sizable amount of unusable product that I dispose of. Maybe 25% at worst. (Obviously I'm motivated to reduce that!)</p>

<p>To simplify finished goods inventory, I'm using an internal transfer price that assumes no waste in making the product.</p>

<p>To balance the books, I intend to take inventory periodically and create a ""plug"" entry:</p>

<pre><code>Book Value of Raw Materials - Internal COGS - Plug = Value of actual inventory
</code></pre>

<p>The plug would be waste.</p>

<p>Suppose I purchased $1000 in lumber to make 20 products, then my internal COGS is $50 each; COGS being cost of goods sold. Now suppose the lumber is used up, and there are only 15 finished, salable products. My Inventory account had $1000 in it. I drew down $750 while using up all the raw materials, so my plug would be $250.</p>

<pre><code>$1000 - $750 - $250 = 0
</code></pre>

<p>My state sales tax would be based on revenue from in-state sales of finished goods plus lumber removed from (sales tax-free) inventory for other uses. So my accounting setup helps answer the question: what is my sales tax base. But I would also put the Waste  entry into my COGS account.</p>

<p>I expect to reach $3000 in sales this quarter for the first time, so I'm trying to do this right before filing taxes.</p>

<p>I am creating a website for a doctor. He has a practice that he owns, and Last week he just bought another practice. The practice that he bought is operating under a different name obviously, since it was owned before by another doctor. So I dont think it would be a good idea to change the newly bought practices name since that name is already familiar to patients in that area and customer base. So here is the problem:</p>

<p>Lets call the 1st practice the doctor owns a hypothetical name like “EyeMiami5″.</p>

<p>The second practice that he just bought was hypothetically called “GlassesBrickle”.</p>

<p>Now what should I do (Choices) :</p>

<p>1.) Use EyeMiami5.com as the main website, and have an option for locations on the menu bar which shows “EyeMiami5″, and “GlassesBrickle”.</p>

<p>2.) Rename the actual business “GlassesBrickle” To “EyeMiami5″ and have one website with locations but no possible confusion… Which would make no sense because I feel it would cost a loss for the business at the new location.</p>

<p>3.) Have two separate websites with two separate names? I dont think I want to go this route because its a lot more work that would only result in duplicate content and confusion in Google search since its operated under the same Doctor Name. And The bought business has a complicated business name, and Long complicated URL.</p>

<p>4.) Keep the GlassesBrickle Business name for the practice but delete the domain.
Have EyeMiami5 be the main website for both, and SEO optimize the site so it pops up for both businesses. And just have like an opening slide or something say “Dr XXX – The Man Behind EyeMiami5 &amp; GlassesBrickle”. </p>

<p>and have the deleted GlassesBrickle domain redirect to the new site for the rare chance someone types the long GlassesBrickle address in the URL box.</p>

"3699","Competitively Coding in my Job?","<p>I'm not even sure if this is the right StackExchange forum to post this question in, but I want to see how others will look at this, or if I'm just crazy for making assumptions about the job market.</p>

<p>To give a run down, I am a web developer with knowledge of PHP, JavaScript, Java, CSS, HTML, JSON, SQL, mySQL, jQuery, BASH, linux, numerous APIs, and a little bit of Python. (I also hold 4 Microsoft office certifications, So I know my way around those sorts of things).</p>

<p>When I first began looking for a career as a web developer I put together my own ""template"" website with a bunch of features that companies would be interested in, and even hosted it with my own domain to sort of prettify it. The site could handle sign-ups, forms, payment gateways, full on forms for businesses like bowling alleys to host parties, etc etc. ...After sharing this on Facebook for my friends to see a friends brother, who was creating a business with one of his coworkers, took interest in having me create their website. They were unable to pay me for my services because the business had yet to take off, but they promised a pretty good future position in their company, as well as allowing me to use the website with my name on it for any resumes.</p>

<p><strong>Six months later</strong> I've poured basically all my heart and soul, as well as 99% of my free time, into this website while I attend school and they're making some pretty demanding things out of the website. Still unpaid, They soon want me to sign a contract that they've written themselves that basically just says that anything I make for them is now their property (Which basically removes the ""I can put that I made this on my resume""?), and I'm not being included in any site decisions. (IE: They made the call that they want to make clicking on certain pages taking you to ad.fly before the page, which I call is f***ing stupid and would drive people away). They also asked me to make them a whole new feature (with my skills) that has <em>nothing</em> to do with their company, and they want to <em>split</em> the money out of it (IE; Make us this website that we can sell to other people.)!!!</p>

<p>The other thing that scares me is the other day they told me when they do hire other programmers in the future, when the company takes off, they want to tell the tech team ""Hey, heres an idea, the person who makes it A. The Best, and B. The Fastest, gets the money and the credit, everybody else take a hike."" I am aware that competitive programming is a sport of the aforementioned, but I didn't think it were something in companies, only something that companies would be impressed by and hire somebody for? Typically people in large companies have specified roles like Java Developer, Graphic Designer, and Database Manager.

"3701","Is it a good idea to try to bring potentially competing companies together?","<p>This may require a bit of backstory, so bear with me.
I work for a very small company (less than 10 people) in an industry that is small but growing in our city. My company used to be around 30 people, but due to a very large client going under, they were forced to lay off more than half of them. Some of those people started their own company, doing similar things to us (digital media and stuff). They are also very small like us. Two years later, they are doing fine. We are now 2 separate entities, and possibly competitors. To my knowledge, there are no ""hard feelings"" between the owners.</p>

<p>In addition to this, many of my co-workers and employees at the 2nd place went to school together and a few of us are good friends. We talk about work together and how our bosses are handling things (without breaking NDAs). We know eachother's companies pretty well.</p>

<p>I want to have a get-together between the two companies to facilitate good relations and help grow the industry in the city together. I can think of a few possible problems, such as NDA's being inadvertently broken and the ever present uneasiness of both companies being competitors. </p>

<p>Is it ever a good idea to try and grow two companies together, or am I better off just making friends and having get-togethers apart from work?</p>

"3714","Copyright implications of Start-up using unowned Youtube videos","<p>I had an idea to create a start-up that is based around the idea of taking a particular genre of Youtube videos and putting them onto a centralized, web-based application, making it easier for the user to access the videos they want with minimal effort. I have additional ideas to add on top of this to make it more unique but stripping it down to its basics, that is what it will be.</p>

<p>My only concern is that the whole concept of this idea is that I will be displaying videos that I am not the original owner of and potentially making a profit from it e.g. through ad revenue.</p>

<p>Being that these Youtube videos have been posted on a site that everyone has access to, (obviously not EVERYONE) I would assume that as long as you're not claiming the video as your own, you would be able to allow users to watch the video from your site. </p>

<p>What I would like to know is if there is a possibility that this could leader to content owners filing a suit against me for making a profit from their videos.</p>

<p>I am aware of sites such as <a href=""https://www.stumbleupon.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">StumbleUpon</a> that allow you to search through different types of videos depending on pre-selected preferences but am not sure if there are particular copyright rules that they need to follow or if they contact every single content owner for permission to be able to do this. I don't feel that the latter would be feasible.</p>

<p>So my question is;</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Can I post other peoples Youtube videos on my site without their
  permission?</p>

Should I buy an Android for myself, or invest in a dedicated one for the company?","<p>We developed Android first, just because that was where the talent was on our team, and because we wanted to validate the idea before investing in apple products for the developers. We are getting ready to launch the alpha run of our app, and as the non-developer, I don't have an Android that I can personally run the app on. It is very movement intensive and most of it's features are tied to Accelerometer and GPS contexts so running it on a simulator only goes so far. </p>

<p>Should I buy an android for myself and just switch over from my iPhone for now on my personal line or should I get a cheap android and a cheap data plan dedicated to the company? I guess doing both is also an option. </p>

<p>My first reaction was that it doesn't make sense to buy a dedicated line, but there might be a benefit to being able to hand over the phone so another iPhone user for feedback, which I couldn't do with a personal line, because the app works in the context of taking a walk. </p>

"3725","Disadvantages of starting a subsidiary startup company?","<p>Say a holding startup company is interested of opening up an office, or a subsidiary, in a new market in order to ""fortify"" their expansion. In order to limit their risk and/or attract talent they offer up to 40% of ""sweat"" equity in this new subsidiary to a director and his managers of said subsidiary. </p>

<p>In this model, at the outset, 20% of all revenue generated by each subsidiary is automatically redirected to the holding company. </p>

<p>Even though the Director of this subsidiary may receive up to 25% of sweat equity of that company, is he not better demanding some type of interest and/or equity in the holding company? Especially if this market is new and undefined and he's coming in at the beginning of said expansion? It appears, said Director is taking lots of risks, and not necessarily reaping lots of rewards. </p>

2: Sell the hardware at a higher cost, with free access to the web app(not preferable)<br>
3: Sell the product at a lower cost, give free access with ads, and a paid sub for no ads<br>
4: Open-source my hardware design plans, giving anyone access to the hardware components to make themselves, while making the web app a monthly/year sub fee and also offering ""pre-made"" components</p>

And, perhaps not surprisingly, the sales agent is not super helpful in clarifying this point.</p>

<p>Lastly, if a customer does not pay after 180 days, I do not think it would be worthwhile to continue trying to collect and am not planning on suing them.  I will probably forgive this amount but feel that the customer should not have used the services for free.

"3901","Information security & user privacy: how do I make sure my partner/contractor takes as much care of it as I do?","<p>There was a highly publicized security &amp; user privacy issue last month involving <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/02/technology/how-superfishs-security-compromising-adware-came-to-inhabit-lenovos-pcs.html"">Lenovo and Superfish</a>, which bears apparent similarities to the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony_BMG_copy_protection_rootkit_scandal"">Sony rootkit scandal</a> many years ago. The difference between the two cases, in my opinion, is that while the later seems to be attributable solely to bad business ethics, the former, at least on the part of Lenovo, seems to be the unfortunate product of asymmetric information and disparate incentives in a complex business dealing. </p>

<p>This further reminds me of cases similar in nature involving security breaches caused by negligent contractors, like <em>GAP's stolen job applicants' data</em> (in a contractor's laptop), and <em>Stanford Hospital's patient data exposure</em> (which ended up being given by the contractor unencrypted to a potential hire who then posted it on a public website), and many more -- you can search by the italic text for detailed reports since I can't post more than two links.</p>

<p>Suppose I am running a business that handles large amounts of sensitive user data. Obviously from my perspective, part of the objective of contracting or partnering with others is to save myself the trouble of dealing with the details of something that helps me achieve certain technical or financial objectives but is not part of my core business. As the result, there are a lot of things they know and I don't need to know and can't possibly know. So here comes information asymmetry. It will be unlikely, for example, if I rely on the other party to store and maintain user data, that I can go as far as asking how they are encrypting user's passwords, and further, whether they are salted. Taking Lenovo's perspective as in the case with Superfish, I would need to dig deeply into my partner's software to see the not so nice things under the guise of a state-of-the-art craft with cutting edge image recognition and search suggestion technologies, and such inspections themselves would probably be prohibited under the contract (I would definitely prohibit it if I were Superfish). It would probably be even more difficult for me, taking the perspective of GAP or Stanford Hospital, to look into the internal policies of my contractor/partner to see if they secure their data tightly, change their admin password frequently, train their staff properly, etc. And if I have to worry about all these, why not just do it myself?</p>

<p>It would be nice, however, if my partner/contractor had a sufficient incentive to try as hard as I do to protect the sensitive user data. Unfortunately, this is often not the case. While I would be dealing with damaged reputation, disgruntled customers and potential lawsuits, should a security breach occur, and would be paying huge costs, the other party might simply walk away free and clear  (and might even get the bonus of free advertisement like Superfish).</p>

<p>So my question is: </p>

<p><strong>Is there an efficient and reliable mechanism through which I can share the burden of information security and user privacy, and the costs, in case of a breach, equally with my partner/contractor?</strong> Ideally the answer could provide suggestions with respect to the formulation of an agreement or contract, hopefully with specific examples of contractual terms. Other related suggestions of reading, resources, case studies, legal opinions ... would also be greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>One of the employees who has a significant share, treats the project like a cruisy 9-5, takes regular days off to look after kids and averages ~ 3 sick days a month (without any current chronic illness).</p>

<p>I feel like it is generally accepted that a startup requires a different mentality to working for an established company. This however is much harder to express in writing, or definitively argue that their efforts are not up to scratch given the situation.</p>

<p>How should I approach the problem without turning the person in question hostile?</p>

<p>EDIT:</p>

<p>To clarify my description of the work ethic was not specifically related to hours, but more an attitude of not being invested in the outcome of work and more the process of sitting at a desk. </p>

<p>I don't expect people to work more than normal hours, our hours are completely flexible. The problem is when that freedom allows everything else in their life to take priority over work. </p>

<p>Like get to work at 11:15 late for meeting</p>

<p>Go to lunch at 12</p>

<p>Leaves at 4:30 to pickup kids sheepishly</p>

<p>Comes to work next day half asleep and works long hours to make up day before, isn't productive because of lack of sleep from freelance job worked late on.</p>

<p>This combined with frequent days off reduce the actual work output to much lower than I expect.</p>

<p>The pattern is this person is spreading themselves too thin to have energy left for much work at all. The productive number of hours cap in a day can be consumed by non work related things too, I fear too many are being consumed on other things to output a decent amount of work.</p>

It's a SaaS product and we've already got a couple pilot customers ready and waiting, who will paying setup and monthly fees.  Having said that, I think it's fair to say that the concept is tested and has a fairly high probability for success.</p>

<p>There are 3 total partners right now, and one of them is funding most everything.  His risk is pretty low in doing this because he also owns a company that will be a customer.  Worst case scenario, he paid for a sweet product that his company can use - not much different than outsourcing the project and keeping it to himself.</p>

<p>We're considering bringing on a 4th partner who will help develop another area of the business and also help with sales and identifying product features.  The 3 existing partners would kick in equal amounts of equity to bring him on.  There would be no salary for this new partner until we start to make money, which he's fine with due to a nice nest egg.</p>

<p>Now the question... Is it fair to ask for a capital contribution as well?  If so, how much?  I have no idea what the company is worth right now, but about $100K has been spent so far.  The person funding the project now is doing so as debt, so eventually he will get paid back.  If we ask for a contribution, should that also be debt or would it be fair to expect that to go straight to the business?</p>

"3990","Breaking things off with an abusive co-founder","<p>I'm having a problem. A pretty huge problem. My co-founder, that I've known for a few years, is behaving in ways that are unacceptable. He uses company funds for private purchases (always bad, but extra bad in a situation where we have very low funds and can't take salaries because of a lost contract). He is passive aggressive, always blaming me for whatever problems arise. There is always a veiled criticism when he asks questions. </p>

<p>He swears in front of our employees and goes off in wild outbursts of anger targeted at other current or past employees. He lies to me. Initially he wanted to live elsewhere during weekends and be here during the work week. Now he's away 15 of the work days in a month. I constantly have to cover for him.</p>

<p>There are so many issues that it's impossible for me to list them all. All trust has been lost between us and I really want to break off and do my own thing. He's in charge of sales but every contract he signed for our company has been a loss (he's selling too cheap) and the few sales I've done is what has kept us afloat so far.</p>

<p>I know, you all think I'm an idiot for even thinking about this, and you would be right. I need out.</p>

<p>The problem is, how? He's very aggressive and vindictive, he always wants to sue every single person that does him wrong, he talks about sending mafia members after people that wrong him and stuff like that. He's half joking and half serious. Typical psychopath stuff. </p>

<p>The thing is, we do have a partnership agreement saying I can't start a competing business. He knows a few personal things about me that I don't want coming out. And he's a violent guy, so I don't wanna take risks considering I'm married and have kids.</p>

<p>So, how do I break this off with minimal negative effects personally? How do I get him to agree to letting me start a competing business? The market is more than huge enough for both of us, especially since he moved to another country a few months ago.</p>

<p>He did talk about us putting the local company into bankruptcy, something we are close to anyway. That would kind of free me up. </p>

<p>3 months ago, we launched a spin-off (i.e. nice_app_spin_off) of nice_app that is meant to be used by students. In nice_app_spin_off, we provide reporting for students activities, allow teachers to specify (from a web dashboard) which content items a student can view in the app. We are adding new features each release to add more value to nice_app_spin_off and distinguish it from nice_app.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Combine the income of all projects together, that way we can switch projects without personal earning/profitability concerns. Also if a project doesn't work at all people more involved in it won't be affected.</p></li>
<li><p>We keep a big profits' percentage (50%?) for ""the company"" future, for times when no product sells well, buy better working tools and grow.</p></li>
<li><p>The remaining percentage is a salary, divided by each's ""work share"": working hours invested in the projects. We can't set salary amounts as the incomes are completely unknown.</p>

<p>3.1 The income for projects and work share are all dynamic ammounts adjusted constantly as projects sell more/less and people work more/less in them. People actually only ""borrow"" money from their salary percentage as they need limited by their current work share.</p>

<p>3.2 Salary money left at the company buys them ""ownership"" of the company. Some may see no interest or future in the company and take all their work share while some will prefer to not touch it at all and work more to keep a good ownership percentage.</p></li>
<li><p>Buy outs is the same as taking all of ones salary share from 3.2 and walking away from the company.</p></li>
<li><p>Decision making is made according to worked share.</p></li>
<li><p>Once we have an idea of the actual earnings in some six months we evaluate the experience and adjust the contract. Maybe buy out everyone and start fresh?</p></li>

"4051","Is it worth to support iOS 7 for an application which will be released on the App Store on September 2015?","<p>I started the development of an iOS application one month ago (so I am at the early stage of development). I am alone on this project and consequently the only developer and I have to manage other tasks (design, concept of the application, fund raising, etc). I use Swift and iOS 8 to develop this application and do not need to use brand new features only available on iOS 8 (like Apple pay, health, etc). <strong>I need to support iOS 7 for certain features and I take roughly 4 to 5 hours each time to adapt my source code to support iOS 7.</strong></p>

<p><strong>I did my research on the internet and found these two following links:</strong> <a href=""https://developer.apple.com/support/appstore/"" rel=""nofollow"">link 1</a>, <a href=""http://david-smith.org/iosversionstats/"" rel=""nofollow"">link 2</a>. To sum up, these two links tell us that currently there are roughly 19%(13% @Late August) of users using iOS 7 and 79%(86% @Late August) using iOS 8. We also know that nearly each year Apple stops supporting one of their devices. Probably the iPhone 4s in September 2015.</p>

<p><strong>I plan to release my application on the Apple Store on September 2015 and the future release of iOS 9 will occur the same month.</strong> I have checked the most famous applications on the Apple store and on average they only target the current iOS version and the current iOS version minus one (which means iOS 8 and 7 at that time), excepted for exceptions like WhatsApp and YouTube which respectively support iOS 4.3 and 6. </p>

<p><strong>If there were only these data to take in consideration, the choice of not supporting iOS 7 would be obvious in my case, but it is more complicated than that because as you probably know the users having the iPhone 4 will not be able to use my application. They will also not be able to upgrade to iOS 8 (Apple decided to stop supporting the iPhone 4 in all iOS versions > iOS 7.1.2), which means they will never be able to use my application if I do not support iOS 7.</strong> </p>

<p><strong>The problem is that I have not been able to find global statistics (related to the App Store) where the data is grouped by iPhone devices, which could obviously help me to answer to the question, knowing what exactly represents the 19%.</strong> Knowing that and after having consulted the statistics above, my goal is to target as many users as possible, but the number has to be significant. Moreover I also see that the iOS 8 adoption by users steadily increases month after month.</p>

<p><strong>Eventually I am wondering myself if in my case it worth to spend my time supporting iOS 7?</strong></p>

<p>Note: I guess the wisest decision would be to stop supporting iOS 7 from January 2016 (in a perfect world). Nonetheless I am asking this question to you guys in order to know if it is rational and not dangerous for my future application and business to shorten and thus give up (at least for the moment) the support of iOS 7 and use my time for other things.</p>

<p><strong>First</strong> -- I think I want to have full ownership of all stock the company will allocate to me at least a year before we sell the company so that any increase in the the stock's ""base"" value will only get taxed as capital gains.</p>

<p>If my thinking in this makes sense, I want stock, not options, and no vesting plan.  No one in the company has an objection to this, we just want it to make tax sense.</p>

<p><strong>Second</strong> -- As I understand it, if I receive stock for ""services or contributions rendered"" then the stock I receive will get valued as equal to my contributed work and I will need to pay income tax on that value.</p>

<p><em>What is the most tax efficient way I can get the stock?</em></p>

<p><em>Given the company's liabilities, can the founders with their controlling interest simply sell me all the shares the want me to have as a block of treasury shares for a dollar or some nominal amount?</em></p>

<p><em>Can they sell me a portion of their own shares for a dollar?</em></p>

<p><em>Could we do some kind of rapid vesting coupled with me doing an 83(b) election?</em></p>

<p><em>Any other ways to do this?</em></p>

<p>Any guidance or context appreciated.</p>

"4103","Third party app development vs hiring developers","<p>Me and my partners are in the process of deciding how to go about with our app development.
All 4 of us come from non technical backgrounds such as marketing,finance,industrial designing  and law.The requirements for our app technically quite complex(as it was told to us by the developer and a few individuals who are acting as mentors) .</p>

<p>The choices before us is to hire a third party app development firm to handle the initial development of the app .In the mean time we would be working on business development and marketing .This is to ensure that when the product is rolled it is complete not only in technical terms but it has sufficient service providers signed up which would ensure a better experience for users who sign up.This we intend to do during the 5 month development period the app development firm needs.Which means we would have to travel extensively .</p>

<p>So my questions are ,would it make sense for us to work with a third party company to develop the app to ensure a more well finished product instead of something that might look like an amateur job.And use our time towards developing the services which is the criteria to ensure a better user experience when rolling out.</p>

<p>Or should we hire developers to do the same and save the money if it works out well and use that money towards other expenses (as per what we have budgeted after the development costs we would have funds to pay for infrastructure structure costs and salaries to maintain the app for one quarter ).</p>

<p>The disadvantage with the first option is that the price quoted is quite expensive vs hiring developers .The disadvantage with the second option is the developers we hire might not meet out timelines and delay the app and we are also not able to find the sort of quality talent we need right now as they tend to go for the most established names.
The plan is during the development period we are also  looking at recruiting a few heads to manage the app once it is ready . But once the beta is ready our view is that a complete product would also help us reach more talented developers vs the choices we would have now as we are just a project on paper come print for this talent with established names.</p>

<p>So would hiring third party developers to develop the app have any negative consequences such as they implementing certain features which we feel differentiates our business to other products they are developing ? Also contrary to our belief they might take us for a ride due to our obvious weakness in the technical aspects .</p>

<p>If any one could advise me either based on experience or knowledge the drawbacks of both our choices and any further suggestions would be useful.We are based out of India if that makes a difference.</p>

<p>We would have an iOS app ,an Android app and a web app.</p>

"4121","Valuing the company from a convertible note","<p>I'm trying to figure out how convertible notes work. Specifically, I want to figure out my implied valuation from a convertible note. (Yes, I know the point of convertible notes is that you don't have an explicit valuation, but there is an implicit one.) Consider the following example:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Note terms:</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>5% simple, non-compounded interest</li>
  <li>20% discount rate</li>
  <li>$10m cap</li>
  <li>12 months of runway (estimate)</li>
  <li>$1m investment</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>A year from now, raise at a $10M valuation, with a share price of one
  dollar per share. Your investors have 1.0 5M total, thanks to accrued
  interest, and they get to purchase at $.80 a share due to the
  discount. This gives them an ownership stake of 1.0 5M/.8 =1,312,500
  shares; 13% of the total. </p>
  
  <p>So investors will be purchasing a 13% stake a year from now for $1M,
  which gives a nondiscounted valuation of $7.7 M. (Note that this
  valuation is post-money relative to the first raise, but pre-money
  relative to the second. Confused yet?) Investors will often tell you
  that they believe they will average a 20% IRR; this is complete crap
  but whatever. Using that discount rate (the time discount rate, not
  the discount rate of the note) we get a net present post-money
  valuation of $7.7M/1.2= $6.4M. Subtracting the initial investment
  gives us a pre-money of $5.4 M.</p>

"4124","Ownership Logistics in Single LLC","<p><strong>Background</strong></p>

<p>I met someone who registered a single person LLC in July last year, let's call her Susan. There are no outside investors and Susan has put a considerable amount of time and money into the company. </p>

<p>Greg and I met Susan, and decided we wanted to help achieve Susan's vision of creating a marketable product and service. We've been helping since January. In the past few months we have really pushed forward past a lot of obstacles. Susan said she couldn't be where we are without Greg and I. </p>

<p><strong>Dilemma</strong></p>

<p>Greg and I have been promised by Susan, in vague terms, that we are going to be compensated for the work we are putting in. Susan has talked about us being business partners (instead of employees). Greg and I realize how much work Susan has put into the company. Susan realizes how much Greg and I do as well. </p>

<p>Currently none of us (not even Susan) are compensated for our work because there is no revenue. Greg and I don't have contracts or any legal documents protecting us or obligating Susan to do anything. I don't even know what those documents would look like. </p>

<p><strong>Susan's Logic</strong></p>

<p>The company isn't valued at anything yet, so it's hard to figure out what percentage of ownership to give to Greg and I. So after a year or so we will come up with shares/ownership ideas but it's not worth the time/energy now.</p>

<p>To me, this sounds like she wants to take the best cut for herself. Is this a legit reason?</p>

<p>The second line of thought: it costs money to work on legal document changes (to switch out of an LLC) and a multi-person LLC would put Greg and I in legal risk in case of lawsuit. </p>

<p>What do you think?</p>

<p><strong>Ideas?</strong></p>

<p>How can Greg and I protect our time/energy investments for the next year and ensure that Susan is obligated to give us part-ownership? Any advice or opinions? </p>

<p>Does this person sound sketchy? Any gut reactions?</p>

<p>I really trust Susan. She's done business for 30+ years successfully and has owned a couple of verifiable successful ventures. All stories she tells paints her in an honest and good light. I value her word - there's just always a nagging feeling that minds change and I don't want to be screwed out of the many hours Greg and I have put in already. </p>

<p>The strategy we'd like to try is getting a reasonable amount of views (and unique visitors, clicks, etc), maintain a steady growth rate and then go from there. Some initial trials with a minimal viable product have shown great promise.</p>

<p>Now something we're less sure about is saying anything about what's a good absolute number of views, unique visitors, clicks, etc.</p>

<p>Based on careful research we think we could have approximately 50.000 (raw) views after 6 months and approximately 150.000 views per month after a year. We estimate needing close to 10 people to operate the site after a year (developers, an operator and commercial staff) and expect having monthly costs by then (burn rate) of between 40k euros and 50k euros per month (wages, rent of some office, costs for the servers, data bandwidth etc).</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> <em>The 50k euros/month is not for the upkeep of the site, but as investment that will be used for the development of new features and products that we predict will bring us even more views in year 3 to 5.</em></p>

<p>With roughly the same costs per month from then on we expect to double the amount of views after another year (so we'll do 300.000 views per month then).</p>

<p>Now the question is, would that be good (realistic) numbers to aim for? Of course higher is always better, but we'd like to set a realistic number that we can actually achieve.</p>

<p>Should we indeed be doing that amount of views after a year, would that be considered a good number? How many views did some other popular websites without a definite monetization plan approximately had in their first and second year?</p>

<p>One thought is that I could create a new password incorporating something unique to that person, like their middle name (""123Marie456""). That would be simple to switch if I hire a new person.</p>

<li>Donations (The community can be quite generous)</li>
<li>A Groupon type scheme for rewards to active users (How to turn this into money for the site though currently escapes me plus the rewards will need to be provided by businesses which is close to being advertising)</li>

"5327","How do startups avoid trading under insolvency if they're financed almost entirely via debt?","<p>I see that debt is a popular way of financing new businesses, but at least here in Australia, the threat of trading insolvent is quite large for a proprietary limited company. <a href=""http://asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/insolvency/insolvency-for-directors/directors-consequences-of-insolvent-trading/"" rel=""nofollow"">Particularly for anyone acting in a director capacity</a>.</p>

<p>Given that startups initially have a negative cashflow and that they usually fail, how do they prevent the directors being personally liable to pay back the debt or incurring fines from the corporate regulator? Note that this is in reference to Australia, where directors can incur liability for insolvent trading.</p>

<p>Are there ways to write loan agreements to prevent being in a net debt position by having the lender's claim limited to the market value of the company's liquidatable assets minus any accounts payable?</p>

<p><strong>Sample scenario</strong></p>

<p>To make this more concrete, consider a startup that receives a $10,000 due in 1 year. They have only $1 of capital. They spend that $10,000 on development, but the product doesn't sell at all that year. Debt becomes due, but no cash in bank. Hello insolvency! So at what point have the directors made a ""mistake""? Was it initially with taking the loan? Or was it at some point during that year at which paying back that loan seemed unfeasible?</p>

I need a set of landing pages, a way to build up user interest (such as a blog), a way to track bugs/feature requests, a wiki for documentation, forums and a way to order the product.  I do not expect to find a super large audience (maybe a few thousand users) nor am I selling it for a lot of money (10-20 dollars), so I can't justify too much cost.</p>

<p>The methods I see are using something like Steam, which would require me to start greenlighting, but that also ties me to a platform.  I could also use something like the Amazon software sales system, etc.  I could start up a kickstarter campaign and use facebook/twitter to generate interest, but I still would lack a method of selling the product.  There is the build it myself approach, but that takes a lot of my time away from my own software development.  I could pay someone to build a website, but I imagine that is not cheap.  Finally, there are vendors that offer 'sales' packages that might meet some of my needs, but not all of them.  I could perhaps try to 'bolt on' some additional tools, but I have doubts that it would look professional.</p>

Everything was going good until the contact failed to respond to any emails or calls for a couple weeks.

<p>A major problem I have encountered is, that as soon as I mention that I study Computer Science or am a decent programmer, there seems to be a huge shift in their behavior towards me. When I was seen as an intellectual equal before when exchanging ideas, I am now suddenly treated a tool that can implement their grand ideas for them. My input from then on seems to be disregarded and they only focus on my technical knowledge.</p>

<p>Did other co-founders in tech fields have similar experiences when communicating with possible co-founders from business related fields? </p>

<p>Have I only met people I don't have any synergy with as a co-founder or can someone give me advice to be seen as a more equal co-founder?</p>

The reasons they cite is that having someone that's not working, didn't put a lot of money but have equity is bad in front of an investor. I want to sell the equity at the value the society pact says it has. They say they don't have money to buy it, and that it's fair that I just leave for the small amount.</p>

"5498","Increasing capital to decrease associate's ownership percentage","<p>I have a little startup situation. Of course all the characters are fictitious ;)</p>

<p>A few years back, four persons decided to start a software startup. Things were as follow:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Capital: $10.000</p></li>
<li><p>Mister A, Manager, 40 % of shares</p></li>
<li>Mister B, Cofounder, 20 % of shares</li>
<li>Mister C, Cofounder, 20 % of shares</li>
<li>Mister D, Cofounder, 20 % of shares</li>
</ul>

<p>Mister A and B are experienced businness managers.
Mister C and D are young software engineers and know nothing about business and management.</p>

<p>For the past year or so Mister A and B have been working closely together on customer development.
Mister C and D were sometimes consulted on some technical points.</p>

<p>Now the startup has a few clients so it doesn't look so bad.
Mister A and B then told Mister C and D that the capital needs to be increased to $20.000 so that banks and other investors take us seriously.</p>

<p>Mister B, who has been working more than Mister C and D, proposes to invest in the startup. The result would be as follow:</p>

<ul>
<li>Mister A, 40 % of shares</li>
<li>Mister B, 40 % of shares</li>
<li>Mister C, 10 % of shares</li>
<li>Mister D, 10 % of shares</li>
</ul>

<p>After that Mister A will increase the valuation of the startup and look for external investors. This means that the shares of Mister C and D will again decrease.</p>

<p>Mister C and D are confused. They know that Mister B worked hard on the startup but feel that going down to 10% is a bit harsh.</p>

<p>So here are the questions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Does that look like a fair proposition?</li>
<li>What are the options for Mister C and D?</li>
</ul>

<p>EDIT:</p>

<p>The goal is more to reward B for his work.
Most likely C and D will express their interest in investing as well.
In the end, I think everybody still want to work together. </p>

<p>A and B worked closely together because they get along well, know a lot about customer development and have lots of relations.
C and D want to get involved but have been (un)intentionally ""left behind"" for various reasons but mostly because they're young programmers.</p>

"5505","Small Business Start Up -- Disadvantaged Customers, how do you work the money?","<p>I'm debating a start up in my local metro area.  </p>

<p>The business is based on recent experiences in automotive repair.  It seems that the Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEM's) are reluctant to support vehicle repairs to engine computers and related anti-theft devices more than ten years after the vehicle is manufactured. </p>

<p>The business model is a mobile repair business focusing on vehicle keys (replacement and recoding) as well as Powertrain Control Module coding. The business provides a necessary service helping folks keep their vehicles running and on the road! In the scheme of life, a mobile business has pretty low investment costs.  You need a service vehicle, mechanical tools and software tools.   </p>

<p>I'm a retired automotive OEM engineer (no longer in Detroit), my son will be the one primarily running the business.  I will be on call for difficult technical issues.  It's clear there is a market for the service.  And when the car you need to get to work isn't running, customers can get pretty desperate to get it fixed. That's a good and bad thing.  Key values we want to maintain in our business are high integrity work and honesty with customers.  The fact that it's a mobile business gives us more flexibility... if we're busy we don't take jobs, period.  Jobs generally tend to be done one at a time (subject to replacement parts availability...)</p>

<p>But here's my issue.  I'm guessing the majority of customers in this range are those where money is tight, really tight.  My fears:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>We do the job, fix the car on site, and the owner refuses to pay.  Unlike a brick and mortar repair shop we have zero leverage in this case.  (A brick and mortar won't release the car to the owner until the bill is paid.)  Car is running and we're out of luck.  We could disable the car, but that's sleazy, not in our ethics.  Disabling the car might mean removing the engine computer, or adding lock on boot to vehicle wheel, etc...</p></li>
<li><p>We do the job, get paid via credit card, and two days later charges are reversed (without any cause other than money is too tight...) </p></li>
</ol>

<p>I'm not worried at all about the repair side of the business... I'm way concerned about the money, and safety side of things.   Concerned enough that this issue stops our high tech mobile business repair model dead on the tracks.  </p>

<p>One thought is to just make this a cash business, using an armored lock box on the truck for cash deposits.  Customers show cash to us first before we start any repair.  </p>

I have just discussed my role with the Founder and it seems he did not consider me as a co-founder, as I had thought. Any advice is appreciated as I negotiate my position in the next few days. </p>

<p>Background:</p>

<p>Just graduating from buisness school, I met someone to co-found my business plan with through mutual friends. I was looking for someone in IT to partner with me and build on the business plan I had built over the past year in graduate school. He (the Founder) had a business plan that created products in several industries across several countries, all of which industries I had expertise and experience in but the most profitable one was the industry that I had built my business plan in. When we both realised we were working on building in the same industry and in my home country, it was a no brainer. Upon our second meeting, he immediatley asked me about equity and salary. We never really discussed anything, instead I took my time to get to know him and his busienss plans. He showed me that he was just in the start-up phase of one of his products and in one country (not my home country) and promised me that we could start immediately on building my business plan. I decited not to invest money, he had already invested over $100k into his start-up. I was told that he had low level staff working for him already and that he had plans to hire more admin staff. I asked him to pay me the same salary as the admin staff, since everything was out of his pocket. </p>

<p>Fast forward to month 3 and I have been receiving salary and contributing to the business as a product developer, website design, website user experience, business plan and development, research and development, photographer, investor pitches (as a founder does)... but development for the products that I did not have in my business plan, but expertise in. The product for my business plan will be built within the next month. </p>

<p>He has not given any employee contracts yet, as he has said he will write everythig up when we move into our new and bigger office in 2 weeks. When the other employees saw that my email signature said ""co-founder"" they sat him down and asked why they were not considered co-founders too. These two employees do Sales and Customer Service (one even has plans to move soon!). This is when the Founder and I discussed that he couldn't consider me co-founder because then he would have to give the other two employees co-founders as well since they were ""hired"" before me. He said I will be appointed CEO of the industry and country I am in and that titles aren't important. he added I will be compensated with shares immediately, unlike them. Therefore, the business credit will go all to him whereas, I believe I should be the one given credit for the founding of the business idea that I have plans to build in the next month. </p>

<p>I believe I should at least get the title late co-founder or co-founder of the industry and country I'm in (if that's possible). I don't want to risk losing this business opportunity over a title, but establishing my important contribution to the business as a whole is very important to me. Would I get just as much credit as a CEO- what are people's experiences with this? </p>

"5551","Easiest way for two people to get a mobile app off the ground","<p>I talked out loud about an app I've wanted to build for a card game I play a lot, at a tournament of said card game, and one of the players was a fellow programmer who absolutely loved the idea. He first wanted to make an open source, free of charge solution but I made it clear that I want to be compensated for any work I put in which he eventually agreed to. We did not know each other at all before this discussion, and we've built a skeleton app and have booked our calendars for coding sessions.</p>

<p>Now, here's my question; if this would've been something I'd kept to myself, I would just code the app, release it and cash in but now that there's a guy who have the opportunity to screw me over here, it immediately looks more complicated to me. What's the easiest way to make sure that our respective shares of the revenue is protected from each other and that the ownership of the app is shared between us? This is just a hobby project for both of us and I don't think this idea has the potential to earn more than a couple thousand, but I'm putting valuable time into this and I want to know I'll get something back. We don't need any capital, only our expertise to get this thing running.</p>

"5558","Belated investment / equity question","<p>I have spend a lot of my free time for the last 10 years working and refining my software product (target audience are web developer). It is quite unique and is distributed as a free software to a great success. More than 30,000 developers have tried it worldwide, one of our partners (based in India) has presented our product to 1000s of students and delivered few 100s of sessions. Product has been used in over 500 european companies - large and small (and for the most of those they have discovered it on their own) and I've sold around 50 professional licenses before I decided that charging for software is not a sustainable model and decided to re-focus on Software as a Service model instead. The hard preparation are complete and before taking a dive in, I'd like to secure our first funding round.</p>

<p>Going forward, I have prepared a comprehensive business strategy based around ""Platform as a Service"" concept. I'm willing to take our existing user-base and offer them our new Cloud platform services. I have a technical partner willing to give us free initial hardware and several technology partners who want to work alongside with us. We also plan to re-start our training strategy in India on a 10-times larger scale and reach out much wider audience while also promoting our new PaaS. I'am also ready to ink the deal with a partner willing to fund those efforts.</p>

<p>The reality of our situation: we're still tied up with a lot of consultancy work and much of our energy is spent on other clients to make our living. We have discussed and made a commitment to work full-time on a product once we can afford to pay ourselves some salaries. I also need help in some areas where we're not strong such as marketing.</p>

<p>I have many friends, contacts and even clients who are very interested in investing in what I'm doing. I would like to give them a chance to invest into my business, so that we have some breathing room for the next year and have some free money to spend.</p>

<p>Dear StackExchange, I'd like to have some suggestions as to how much equity I should give away and how should I valuate my business. I thought about giving 10% away at 5m EUR valuation, is that a realistic figure? Our downside is that we have no cashflow right now, other than that, we're doing great.</p>

"5577","Impact of bonusses on company culture","<p>One of the things I see very frequently in companies is that employees are offered a fixed salary (which is okay) and a variable bonus on top of that. Especially in sales this happens a lot based on a sales-out target - but software developers are also frequently offered bonusses f.ex. based on projects finished within time and budget.</p>

<p>For a long time now I have been thinking about the impact these bonusses have on the culture of a company. I believe that bonusses tend to make people more self-centered, which can seriously harm business (e.g. they will usually ackomplish the task, but with less regard for the big picture). I also wonder if you really need them, because you usually already have things like appraisal talks in place.</p>

<p>However, I also found it very difficult to hire f.ex. sales people without a target (I've seen a lot of good sales guys that demand a target), and found a 'normal' base salary of sales people without a target unproportionally high with respect to f.ex. software developers. This of course also has an impact on team culture, because people might (IMO justly) experience the difference in salary as 'unfair'.</p>

<p>So, that's a paradox. I'm always happy to learn new things, so I've been wondering if people here have (both other and similar) practical experience on how bonusses influence culture in a small startup and what good / bad practices are? Or perhaps there are other ways to solve these issues?</p>

"5588","Expansion strategy based on current external business partners model","<p><strong>Bit of context</strong></p>

<p>My company is a small startup company, owned 100% by me. Culture is important, I want to make complex software that matters. Focus is building 'big data' products, that is: high performance database systems and search engines (that is: the combination of the two) and some 'stuff' to make that work in a project such as web crawlers and text processing engines. Most time is spent (80%+) building the actual products and doing serious R&amp;D on the main product (data analysis) which is basically a super-fast database/search engine built from scratch. Customers are mostly government, medical, etc, that want to analyze data and run into trouble with more traditional BI/DB systems.</p>

<p><strong>USP</strong></p>

<p>The big data product makes it possible to analyze lots of data based on very simple formula's, which are then executed within a few seconds. The benefit from this approach is that domain experts can create queries without having any understanding of 'difficult' things like SQL and BI, thereby reducing data intelligence projects from months to mere minutes. Also, there are plenty of domain experts out there, and not so many big data experts, which means it's easy to find the necessary people for the task at hand.</p>

<p><strong>Ext business partners</strong></p>

<p>At some point in the first year of the company I decided against hiring sales personnel in the short term. Back then, this was a difficult choice; I couldn't find a suitable business partner, didn't have a lot of money and (most of all!) needed the time to build the product. However, you need money to survive, so I decided to use my network to find external business partners instead.</p>

<p>Time is still a major issue; there's just so much work.</p>

<p>Because of the above context, I've been looking at (smaller) consultancy firms as external business partners. They can do the sales by selling strategy, trainings and the expertise to provide a business solution. My company provides the product (+support) to do the data crunching to support that and a (small) project to get everything up and running. </p>

<p>The main benefit from this approach is that a <em>lot</em> of time is saved.</p>

<p><strong>Experience</strong></p>

<p>First off, don't get me wrong: the company is doing fine, I just feel like I've hit a ceiling and want to figure out what the best way forward is. I also have some good ext. business partners that mix just fine. It just doesn't feel like that's enough.</p>

<p>However, I did notice some problems. The one most important is this: Each company has its own focus; external business partners are no different. Most consultancy firms that I've met don't want to sell products; they want to listen to the customer, and then provide him with the product that matches <em>exactly</em> what the customer tells them. </p>

<p>This is a problem for me, because (1) I want them to push my product, not some arbitrary product out there; (2) they value big suppliers over small suppliers because that's what most customers believe is 'right'; (3) if I let a customer and the consultant decide what product they want, it could shift my company's focus in a way I don't want it to shift.</p>

<p>To motivate them to sell my product, I've tried things with kick-back fee's etc, so far without any luck. I also make sure my company has the (product) contract and do the last piece of the sales process to ensure we can deliver.</p>

<p><strong>Question</strong></p>

<p>My question is: what would be the best expansion strategy from here? </p>

<p>F.ex. possible options are: (1) Motivate external business partners in another way? (2) Use a different type/industry of external business partners? (3) Put more effort in hiring a good sales guy? (4) Put all focus on the product, focus on marketing it on a global scale once it's done by hiring someone? (5) Something else?</p>

<p>I'm a software developer in NYC. It's really expensive to hire engineers in America, and I'm wondering why startups just start off by hiring foreign (Russian, Chinese, Indian) labor or even moving to Russia, China, or India to start their startup, while doing business in the US? Lets say the language barrier and assimilation was not an issue for the person trying to found this company, wouldn't this save so much money / risk? You could pay foreign labor costs while making American money.</p>

<p>I ask this because I'm bilingual in Chinese and English, and I want to venture off into my own business (probably a tech startup) eventually. Given that I don't mind living in China or Taiwan, couldn't I minimize so much risk (paying $500 per engineer per month instead of $6,000-$10,000) by just moving there and paying for labor there while targeting American customers?

"5659","Releasing Existing purchased software as new project or even opene source","<p>Does anybody have any experience in purchasing software in this case a comprehensive Wordpress plugin framework for use in client development works then re-releasing it under a new start-up entity as paid software or even possibly as a open source project backed by the new entity (company).</p>

<p>Aware this sounds dodgy and risky, but the situation is the company that supplied the framework has now gone dead. With hundreds of buyers in their support form flooding it with ""Help"" ""Support needed"" ""is this still alive"" and words to that effect - zero response from support now for over 12 months, emails or forums  (the software is still available for purchase). many pages of the company website is now 404 including contact pages. (except the buy page where you can still successfully buy - they are using a 3rd party online seller )</p>

<p>Also worth mentioning,  many developers complaining about clients works now on hold unable to continue until support is provided for the original purchase. </p>

<p>The thing that comes to attention is the fact I and many other developers have gone ahead and re-coded much of the framework (I have invested over 400hours so far and working on it nearly everyday) to remove bugs and clean it up. - the reason for the big investment is the potential this framework has in the long term, my own client works are now completed in a third of the time (minus bugs fixes to the framework) each project I continue to fix the software and make it better. (I now consider myself an expert at work arounds and achieving my requirements with this software) </p>

<p>I'm considering a couple options and wondering what others would consider.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>just strip the source code of all reference of the original makers and publish as a open source project.</p></li>
<li><p>invite existing buyers (on their own support forum) to form a small team to fork the project and keep moving ahead and release under another entity.
(and sell the product offering support to existing and new customers) </p></li>
</ol>

<p>it appears there is now a small few developers providing simple support answers in the like ""this is how I fixed that bug"" </p>

<p>there is opportunity here to grab and run as the company might be dead but the project is very much alive. </p>

<p>regarding legal and copy-write etc, I'm thinking the risk is worth it as I assume such a company would not sue (it appears dead) but if they do I would be happy to challenge with 100% support from their own customers. </p>

<p>In my country I would be covered by trading laws and have opportunity to challenge them in my favour right now as a buyer of a system provided with support (but none given) - as buying a product ""not fit for its purpose as marketed"" - they market they provide support and ongoing updates.....   </p>

<p>but as a supplier from a another country I assume only laws from their own country applies which could be anything. </p>

<p>if they are in fact dead, any attempts of litigation would prob be out of their financial reach...    </p>

<p>As per the original question I have a genuine interest if anybody else has successfully re-released a dead product under a new entity within a similar situation. </p>

<p>or what other options could be considered to bring the project back to life to the general global community as paid or free product.  </p>

They have offered me X RSUs and I was told the preferred stock price of last round of funding which happened not long ago. Is it reasonable to use that number as the target IPO price?</p>

<p>EDIT: I did some research and found some articles that disclosed the preferred stock price of previous rounds of funding this company had done. That price is actually greater than the preferred stock price in latest round of funding. That is baffling to me. I thought if the company valuation is going up, the preferred stock price should go up, but clearly it doesn't have to be that way. Why?</p>

<p>Also I thought if some investors have paid X to get the shares, they wouldn't let an IPO happen below X, but clearly that also does not seem to be the case. Why? At time of IPO my understanding is that preferred stock gets converted into common stock. Is there a multiplier associated so that 1 preferred stock gets converted into 10 shares of common stock - that would be one way that would explain above.</p>

They make plans, designs, sketches, etc. for their SaaS/web app, but not much coding. They're about to begin making a visual, non-functioning demo of their product (in other words, just an HTML skeleton of their webpage), when all of the sudden, Jack brings up many reasons to avoid the meetings and work sessions. Family emergencies, social commitments, random chores, and so forth. Jack does not make any sincere efforts in rescheduling. This becomes the norm.</p>

<p>Will does his part, but it's unconfirmed whether Jack has done his part in building his half of the visual demo. </p>

<p>Perhaps Jack is being honest. The lack of rescheduling on Jack's part causes Will to begin doubting Jack's intentions. </p>

<p>Seeing that the release of the beta has been stalled for nearly a year, Will decides that perhaps Jack is slowing him down, and begins to consider parting ways with Jack. Will does want to continue building the project.</p>

<p><strong>Question: If Will chooses to part ways, what is Jack entitled to?</strong></p>

<p>Recap:</p>

<li>Jack has become very flaky</li>

<li>Jack has contributed to the rough draft/basic design of the service, probably 50/50 with Will</li>
<li>The company isn't worth anything right now; no copyright/trademark/LLC/Inc paperwork has been filed</li>
<li>Should the two part today and Will develops the company, Jack's contributions would have amounted to less than 1% of the company's product</li>

<p>(Including my company from disclosing my clients and my clients disclosing my company performs works for them as well as protecting the information shared between both parties) </p>

<p>The contract I use is a drafted by legal team and kept up to date with current laws in my country the process of implementation includes submitting the contract to client where then they have opportunity to seek independent advise and submit amendments this can go on a few times until all parties agree and sign. </p>

<p>It a great system and never a complaint about process or the contact itself. 
However, this contract stipulates that is only enforceable under the law of the country the contract was written (makes sense).</p>

<p>Now in a position of considering international clients I’m seeking if there is any experience on this board with regarding developing process of implementing a Confidential Contract between client and service provider internationally.</p>

<p>Or could a simple “terms of service” be enough, eg, to use the service you agree not to disclose you are using the service or publicly release information shared between parties in regards to the service provided. Etc</p>

<p>I’m thinking a terms of service might be enough only enforceable by cancelling service if terms are breached (rather than the investment of seeking legal for possible damages in case of breach)</p>

<p>Genuine interest in any experience in this area,</p>

<hr>

<p>Just to extend further information regarding why such a company (service provider) would be in need of confidentiality is because the method of operations and how services are provided – not illegal nor immoral just quite unique and creative that is considered easily copied by competitors if aware. (The service is not a grand idea the method of delivery is) During the startup phase the company is only providing services to invited clients and their referrals to help get a kick start ahead of the rest, and looking for a few international clients in the bag so to speak before opening right up to the general public with a bit of self funding behind the scenes. </p>

"5729","Equity and founders when getting funding for long existing product (6 yrs)","<p>I've been involved with a product since it's inception as the technical side of things, working with one other person who is the idea+product guy (no ability to code or do technical).  We are long time friends, and it started a long time ago at this point 6 years back. It has gone from being a side project, to an idea put to use in a small local community, to the product guy quitting his day job to try and focus on it as a business, all the way up to achieving friends+family funding finally, at the 6 year mark.  It's goal is a Series A funding in 7-10 months now.   </p>

<p>Along the way it has many slow points, mainly struggling with the concept of finding time to grow it, then once time was found, struggling with the idea of funding and viability. It has stalled at times due to lack of direction, next steps. Up until this friends+family funding it has just been the two of us working on it, both committed to its growth, but with me doing the majority of work by time simply because building the product out takes more time product phase.  It has generally been considered his product, but that are partnership was one of equals.  We discussed that several times, that I never expected to work for him one day, but to be his full partner. </p>

<p>As the development side, I've built everything (server, db, web app, ios app), and there is probably 100k lines of code out there to show for it.  He has come up with the product design to drive it, and the core ideas which I've massaged into a working prototype.  Along the way he has also paid me for large project sections, mainly because of the significant work needing development.  Various sections might have been 100 hours of work from me over 3 months, where his product and testing side took 10-15.  I charged him a very low rate as a friend, perhaps $25/hr rate for the paid projects, where I charge $100/hr market rate to my real jobs.  Any given year he might have paid $2-$4k.  In between paid projects I continued working and supporting and might estimate 60% was unpaid work overall, with same day response+fix time always.</p>

<p>We're now 6 years in, and after a year of establishing this friends+family funding trying to determine my role in this as continued development lead.  $200k in this funding.  3 others have joined in sales and business roles, who are the ""friends+family"" investors and now workers too.  A decent valuation was placed on the company with an existing platform, idea, and audience.  Investors and employees probably have about 15% total equity at this point, and the product guy effectively has the rest as the main holder of the keys.  He is open to give some away to grow the team, but is still the holder.  We both want me on board as the continued technical side, but are trying to figure out the details.</p>

<p>What is a fair way to determine the equity at this point?  There is a bit of disagreement in this, which has put unease in me.  Mainly because I've assumed and expected co-founder status going in, with 6 years under my belt.  He has said he doesn't want to use titles or terms like that, and that we're all a team. (he still holds all the equity).  So, overall factors:</p>

<ul>
<li>both 6 years in working, long hard sweat equity and commitment</li>
<li>I've developed all the code and product, leading to much of the valuation at this point.  i know it all in+out, no one else does.  i would build the entire product going forward, manage any tech developers</li>
<li>he pulled together the friends and family funding over a long year.</li>
<li>he's paid me over the years, but I've done significant more work by hours</li>
<li>payment was well below market rate (25%), and i've committed extensive unpaid time also (60% unpaid)</li>
<li>he quit his day job a 1.5 yr ago to focus on this, albeit slowly, and claims greater risk taken.  I can work equivalent hours along side my day job though. I had a 8 month devoted period 1.5 year ago, but needed a job eventually.</li>
<li>he is the defacto holder of the created business at this point, until I join in officially.  an llc was established last year, but until now has not had a purpose other than name.  now is the first time partnerships are being established and valuation given.</li>
<li>we have no other written agreements or partnerships, beyond being good friends working on a project</li>
</ul>

<p>Is it absurd for me to assume a cofounder entry point?  While I don't have to assume 50% founder equity, I would expect at least 40% to his 60%.  Am I wrong and should be expecting a generous first-employee entry at best, since he has paid me some of the years?  Since valuation is based on the entire 6 years product build, unofficial until now, doesn't that give me something from sweat equity alone?  </p>

<p>I wanted to find a formula for pricing my products, so that I could price them fairly such that purchasing more would result in more discount.</p>

<p>The pricing goal was to achieve this:</p>

<pre><code>If you purchase 50 pieces, you should pay 2500 (units) per piece.
.
.
.
.
If you purchase 10000 pieces, you should pay 300 (units) per piece.
</code></pre>

<p>The minimum salable count is 50, and there is no more discount for purchases over 10,000 pieces. I wanted to find the discount in between. But I didn't want it to be <strong>linear</strong>. To get linear filling, I could use Excel's linear extrapolation techniques.</p>

<p>However, what I wanted was to have a logarithmic (exponential) discount curve, <strong>to highly encourage customers, to purchase more</strong>. That is, by doubling the order, they would receive a huge discount in lower quantities.</p>

<p>However, based on the answers, I found out that the resulting chart would be something like this:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/bOdtv.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Which is absolutely wrong. Because it financially means that ""if you buy 4000 units you should pay more than when you buy 8000 units"". Of course it doesn't make sense. Now I'm trying to find the data series that can create an increasing amount of payment. But I can't figure it out, and my mathematical knowledge is not helpful here.</p>

<p>So, if you have <strong>minimum_salable_pieces_count</strong> sold at price <strong>x</strong>, and <strong>discount_limit_pieces_count</strong> sold at price <strong>y</strong>, and you want to have an <strong>exponential discount model</strong>, how would you find the intermediate prices for each amount of purchase? </p>

It will be first targeted to local market in my own country.
I want to contact potential customers and do a pilot period of 3 weeks with them, to testdrive the product and gather feedback. I'm not sure if I should let them pay for this a small amount yet. "" <em>The real product will be 199 but you have the opportunity to testdrive it for 99 and get a discount afterwards if you become a customer"" could work ( opinions on communicating it that way? ).</em></p>

<ol>
<li>The idea is to generate leads true the internet and a marketing website that promotes the product. No signups or online trial periods for the product to keep better control.</li>
<li>OR, I might select 3 companies myself and target them with an e-mail and call afterwards to see if I can get an appointment.</li>
</ol>

<p>The idea is to get them ""on board"" 
Gathering real feedback from potential customers is gold and gives me an idea if the market is really looking for my product as I believe in. 
My thought would be to get 3 of them ""on board"" and deliver them a presentation and product that they can use for 3/4 weeks. At a discounted or free rate. The only thing asking back would be feedback and evaluation of the product and if it meets expectations / solves real word problems for them.</p>

<p>Any thoughts, suggestions regarding getting a pilot off the ground? 
I would be very interested in founders that have used a pilot approach to land and improve there product and interested in your ideas and thoughts regarding this 
issue. I'm a small startup and its a 1 man-show so far. </p>

<p>My Idea is also to create a simple few slides presentation in keynote Apple style. This will be to introduce the product, give some facts and figures regarding the market. Then heading over to the browser and give a presentation with some real world data using an account that is setup for this demonstration in advance.</p>

<p><em>Also would it be wise to let them sign a confidentiality document as part of the pilot or any contract in general?</em></p>

"5753","When sales start slow, should we try and implement every demands from our first/potential clients?","<p>For the past 2 years, I have been working on a web application for my company, which provides a standardized e-commerce site aimed for a very specific market with specific regulations. The sales model would be based on a subscription fee, so clients would be paying for a continuous service. (<strong>Saas</strong>)</p>

<p>At the beginning of the project, a strong emphasis was put on <strong>industrialization</strong>: we needed a website that could be slightly customizable (mostly design: colors, fonts, pictures...), so it could be redistributed as-is to all clients, and benefit from updates from the codebase automatically: we'd just have to push updates to all clients, ignoring the custom stylesheet.</p>

<p>We launched the product, sales did not start flowing in... so our sales department started pandering to every demand of potential buyers: this meant that I had to add very specific and opinionized features (features that definitely a minor subsets of clients would want) to the codebase, <strong>all while ensuring that these features could be opted-in/opted-out by future clients</strong>, and in a very short delay since negotiations were running fast at the time.</p>

<p>This was harsh, but acceptable at the time since we did not have any running instance yet ; but nowadays I am feeling a twinge of regret. Because now we have one client with an instance running, and the company keeps dealing with these kinds of demands and asking me to implement them.</p>

<p>I feel like this is going against the fundamental idea behind our product: if we are going to tailor each and every site like it is the client's own, maybe we should start charging them for <em>an actual standalone website</em>, and not a subscription fee. Because all of these custom changes add up, and create a monstrous codebase for handling future updates and bug fixes, and making sure that one client's demand does not overlap another client's.</p>

<p>With all these things considered, I cannot help but sympathize with my company for wanting to get clients at any cost to get the project running. I am just worried that <strong>there is currently no line being drawn</strong>, and I do not seem to be able to communicate that feeling to them. I keep telling them ""this goes against our model, you wouldn't call the Wordpress team and ask them to add <em>a field for adding silly pop-up ads on the top-left corner of iPad screens only</em>"" (intentional exaggeration). But we are a launching company, so I guess this is a different situation.</p>

<p>What is your take on this, and do you have any advice to give, whether technical and/or communication-related? Is it a bold move to say <em>""no""</em> to customers <a href=""http://diginomica.com/2013/12/03/true-saas-box-long-black/"" rel=""noreferrer"">like Henry Ford did</a>, when the company is struggling to get clients?</p>

Eventually, I think it would make sense to do an LLC (it'll be a sole-proprietorship, I think). However, should I just register as a DBA for now wait to register LLC until I have a product I can role out? I don't know when I'll have my product ready (probably a few months to a year). I don't want to incur too much expenses until I have something to ship.</p>

<p>Would you suggest registering LLC right away, doing DBA and turning it into LLC later, or just waiting to register anything until my product is finished? Ideally I'd like to start advertising for my product before it's fully ready under the business' new name, but I'm not sure if I need to have everything registered before then.</p>

"5766","Is there a limit to how long you can accumulate startup costs?","<p>I'm researching the construction of some particular computer hardware, but I expect it to be several years (let's say 5) before I may, if at all, complete it. I'd like to be able to write off my research related costs, but I feel like this is something I could only do after successfully selling said hardware. I'm fairly certain the IRS would <em>view this as a hobby</em> until the research is complete.</p>

<p>Maybe not the first year, but given the length of expected research time, as well as the possibility of failure, there's no way I would meet the ""profitable 3 out of 5 years"" rule. Not to mention, my background is much more related to software than hardware, which can also be used to prove that this is a ""hobby"" rather than a legitimate business venture.</p>

<p>An alternative seems to be to continue to accumulate the research costs, then after the 5 years, actually open the business and amortize the cost over 15 years, as a startup cost. But that leaves me wondering, is there a limit to how long you can accumulate start up costs for?

<p>I worked for a startup for  1 and a half years. I was granted equity upon starting of 100k shares with a 3 year vesting period and 1 year cliff. 1/3 vested after 1 year, with monthly increments on top.</p>

<p>Today I handed in my resignation, so I'm wondering if those shares are still mine (I obviously feel they should be, since they represent a reward for effort already made).</p>

<p>The main wrinkle is this; there was never any signed contract for the equity. It was all confirmed via email, sent via the COO and acknowledged via the CEO. The CEO later responded to the same email chain when I'd asked for clarification, again confirming 100k shares.</p>

<p>The email simply referred to them as shares, not share options. It mentioned no buy back facility, no additional clauses, just the vesting schedule, total amount and when the vesting period began. It also didn't mention any strike price, but given that they called them shares rather than options, I would assume there'd be no strike price anyway.</p>

<p>So... are these shares mine? Can I actually do anything with them? Do I need someone to sign something over to me officially (or more officially than an email chain), or am I screwed?</p>

About an hour after they made that feature available, a lot of their customers had a 'WOW' moment, and they were all incredibly happy.

I noticed that I asked the exact same question before, and people didn't really react.

Yet, as far as I saw, I think though people have many ideas around there, this is true until it comes to the idea how the startup should get to be profitable. I'm not a social scientist, but observing folks it seems like people think more in terms of features, activities, and partly even marketing and selling (e.g. how to tell my friends my app is the best in the world!) etc., but not in terms that require more structural thinking, which business models are.</p>

<p>But the question about: why there's such a lack of ideas when it comes to business models types, is another subject.</p>

<p>When you look at the internet market, it seems to be rather a dull picture, with Google being rather a specific ad agency more than anything else (despite its official category of being a tech company).</p>

<p>My question is: are there real (and perhaps with some examples, as well) sensible business models for say social portals or apps other than based on the Ads Model?</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE 29.07.2015</strong>
Thanks for your answers so far.</p>

<p>@rmoestl said something that my mind was diving into, but given examples are in fact something one could start with when thinking of creating a business model for a social portal.</p>

<p>And to the @Mowzer answer, it is not quite in the subject of social apps / webportals. These strategies are, first, nothing quite new, and second, too general; further more, they're suited for selling / monetizing apps.</p>

<p>In order to avoid the answers like these, I'd like to share some short breakdown of how I approach enforcing popular ""monetizing apps"" business, selling, marketing and promotion strategies to social-specific ones (and because all of 40 points are quite repetitive, they can be summarized each in a single point), because I was thinking of it too, and I'm sure many other people were also considering them as a potential solutions.</p>

<p>So here's what I think:</p>

<ul>
<li>Paid Apps revenue</li>
</ul>

<p>In social apps world, paying for an app is rarely a way to go. The Mowzer's answer even answers why it is so.</p>

<ul>
<li>In-App Purchases (or extra payments)</li>
</ul>

<p>Means probably paying for the extra features, pro accounts, additional services within a social app / portal. I know multiple portals trying to earn this way, but I always had doubts if it's a model for the future web: competition appears every month or week, and I don't know if for example Stack Exchange would be profitable if its business model was based only on taking money from its users.</p>

<ul>
<li>Display Advertising</li>
</ul>

<p>Everything was told already on this, we're looking for alternative business models here.</p>

<ul>
<li>App Promotion</li>
</ul>

<p>This is not an answer about a business model.</p>

<ul>
<li>App Development</li>
</ul>

<p>Same as above.</p>

<ul>
<li>Selling App Data or Source Code</li>
</ul>

<p>""if you can't earn on your app, just sell it!"" - selling a software is a market just like any other one. If you can't earn with your business, if it's financially leaking, or not profitable at all, ""then sell it"". This is not really a solution.</p>

<ul>
<li>Sales and Merchandising (E-Commerce)</li>
</ul>

<p>It's probably the most obvious, yet not an easy, way to go. And this is because it's again, another market, another kind of business. You may want eventually to skip ""social"" part and build e-shop, which are like tones there.</p>

<ul>
<li>Partnerships</li>
</ul>

<p>And this one is not quite easy one as well. There are a lot of pitfalls here - one could end up with a dependency on a big costumer (and, for example, if their budget on a marketing on the social portal is to be decreased, which happens from time to time, the portal tops to be profitable), though this one is one I was also considering.</p>

<p>Occasionally, a request will be made for custom code change for a customer.  One partner will take this on and implement the code change.  Since this is sort of like contract work above and beyond the regular work of the partnership, it seems to make sense that the partner who did the contract work should receive the payment from the customer for implementing those services.</p>

<p>For example, suppose the annual profit of the business is $50k and during the year partner A did a custom request for a fee of $10k (this is not included in the $50k).  It seems that partner A should receive $10k + $25k while partner B should receive $25k.</p>

<p>Is this possible?  I have read about guaranteed payments, but that seems to be a fixed, annual payment rather than something that arises from a specific request from a customer.</p>

The company will develop (for now) a single game for smartphones. There is a simple prototype of the game and a comprehensive project proposal for grant application, including financial estimates based on available data from similar startups.</p>

<p>I will participate in the project and my friend has offered me a share of the company. My question is: how can I estimate the worth of say 25% of the company (and thus how much I'd have to pay), which obviously does not even exist at this point? My best guess is to take a look at how much startups doing similar things were worth at a given time (respectively the financial estimates in the project proposal), but that does not factor in the uncertainty involved (I suppose that most startups just die quickly). How should I approach this problem? Or should I not invest into the company all together at this point? I believe that it can be successful, of course. Thank you!</p>

<hr>

<h3>Background</h3>

<p><strong>Co-Founder's Proposal.</strong>
I had a co-founder ask me to write the code for a startup. I was to contribute the code in exchange for shares. The company would end up having full ownership of the code I would write plus any additional code that I wrote that would have a bearing on the company. He wanted me to give him a list of all the things I have already built and anything not on that list that I would build in the future would belong to the company. That seemed unreasonable to me.</p>

<p><strong>My Counter Proposal.</strong>
Instead, I offered to write the code but give the company ""use"" of the code in exchange for shares. ""Use"" would be an indefinite and unlimited license. If the company wanted to own the code in the future, it could either purchase it from me or hire someone else to write its own.</p>

No legal entity was ever formed, and nothing was ever signed. From roughly April to mid June, I spent approximately 200 hours researching and developing the app. The other two guys had no role in any of the development and spent no time in any part of the development.</p>

<p>About six weeks ago it became apparent to me this arrangement wasn't going to work. I was the one doing all the work, and one of the other guys decided the time wasn't right for him to move forward with this. Because of this, and a couple other reasons, I decided I didn't want to form a parntership with them.</p>

<p>My question is this, who owns the source code to the app? I claim I do since I put 100% of the effort and time writing it, and wasn't paid anything. One of the other guys, who is an attorney, claims I only have a 1/3 interest in the app. Who is right?</p>

<li>Work organization is not good. When we were in developing mode it was fine and then we kinda loose control and lately everybody does what they think it's right.</li>
<li>How CTO (the other co-founder) treats people. One guy already quit and he said his it is because he wants to do something else but I think it's  also that sometimes CTO insisted that he first talk to him for 15min cause he has to go although that guy wanted to eat dinner first.

(E.g., to make sure I don't have to ask anyone about re-using my code (separate or together with the business plan) for any future expansion.)  Do I have to incorporate, and have my corporation own a certain percentage of the partnership, instead of me owning anything directly?</p>

<p>Ideally, if things go very well, I'd like to have full and exclusive rights to partner with any other licensed agents of this sort, in areas where my original partner doesn't do business in.  (I envision that such future partnerships would likely be under a different structure, e.g., without such partners owning any part of my business, unlike the original partner that would likely have a more guaranteed participation in the project, limited to the areas of their licence.)</p>

<p>Is the idea of having some sort of a joint partnership legal structure wrong to begin with?  (I briefly mentioned my original idea for a startup to one of the local licensed agents I potentially want to ""partner"" with, and they suggested that they would likely want to have a ""partnership"" for such cooperation, offering to provide certain extra insights on the business they're in, potentially having to do with the licensed aspect of it as well.)</p>

"6010","Expanding Upon Advisor/Consultant Role in Startup","<p>I am currently an advisor receiving .75% equity with a startup in Chicago for (on a paper) 5 hours worth of time/month.  I say on paper because realistically I am providing more like 10 hours/week in support at the moment (8x of advisor contract). As a medical professional with a love for the tech space this company is in, I want to have a greater role and feel it is highly important for them to have me on board as somewhere between a co-founder and first hire.  The 2 current co-founders are not at all in the medical field (despite their company offering somewhat of a service in this space), thus I know I would help legitimize the company with a greater role as well as continue to offer my expertise. </p>

<p>I have been working with them for 3 months and I believe they may get VC money in the next 2-4 months.  While I'm not a published figure who will be the face of the company, I want to get on board with being a hire for much greater equity (and some sort of salary) making a much greater contribution to the company. While maybe not ""reliant"" on my contributions, I think the co-founders see me as being incredibly valuable to their business operation. </p>

<p>I am concerned that the cofounders are being advised to hold me off for as long as possible considering they are getting almost a free service out of me at the moment as hard working advisor.  While I do trust the cofounders 100%, I want to both protect myself from getting taken advantage of and also want to set myself up to have a steady flow of income from this opportunity that I feel will succeed. </p>

<p>Do you have any recommendations as to how to move forward in this type of situation?  I certainly feel I can make a huge impact as a cofounder...but I doubt they want to give me cofounder equity (or title). </p>

<p>I was feeling like moving forward with this in the next week might be smart, rather than waiting until the have VC money.  I've certainly weathered a risk getting involved as an advisor. I would be happy to continue to take on the startup risk with a much greater bump in $ and equity, which of course would allow me to offer more time/energy to help the company grow.</p>

<p>First of all, I am a software developer, with 12 plus years of commercial development experience. I have used a variety of development platforms over the years, and have used cloud computing services extensively over the past few years to develop scale-able software.</p>

<p><strong>Idea</strong></p>

<p>I am convinced that I have a good idea for a website. </p>

<p>I am facing a dilemma in that, I want to share this idea with someone who I can trust, who is experienced enough in the IT industry, to honestly say - whether it will work or not, but someone who will not run away with the idea behind my back :-)</p>

<p>I am a realist - I know that having a day job and a young family, mean that I need help, even to develop a prototype. Again, the person I hire for working on this website must be trustworthy.</p>

<p>My question is this: is there a way to employ a developer and only let him work on bits and pieces, so he/she does not get the whole picture/idea? I am pretty sure this would not work, as it will become pretty apparent what I am trying to do.</p>

<p>What are the alternatives? Should I patent the idea (spend big bucks for something I do not know will be successful or not)? Should I contractually bind the developer in a non-disclosure agreement? Should I offer the developer a share of proceeds when they happen (maybe years into the future)? Or all of the above?</p>

<p><strong>Side Notes</strong></p>

<p>Also note that while I have many friends in the IT industry, most of them do not have time for a side-project, certainly not the amount of time I would require for this project, so I cannot hire them.</p>

"6026","What do I use to value my startup?","<p>I'm looking for parameters and approach on how to value my startup, not the actual number.  This is in US but not in Silicon Valey where things are... different.</p>

<p>In 2010 I've created a niche SaaS cloud-based enterprise software product.  Product got some attention in the industry, but generally it was not very good and I never could even afford to quit my day job to run it full time.  At its best days it was generating $15k/MRR.  I've had contractors help me maintain it.  But overall, the product was going nowhere.  It was poorly constructed, looked like crap, poorly scaled for large customers, and was branded too narrowly.</p>

<p>A year ago, I finally decided to get very serious about my business.  I figured since I learned so many lessons, talked to so many customers, gathered contacts in the industry, assembled an email list of 3000+ very relevant signups, understood so much more, I would do well by making another attempt at this.  </p>

<p>I decided to replatform, redesign, and rebrand.  Since I saved up a bunch of cash when I was earning double/triple salary, I've hired a good contractor team to help me build a new product.</p>

<p>Result after 9-10 months of very hard work: new product is beatiful; works very well; scales nicely; and is architected for rapid growth.  It offers a ton of great enterprise features and is very well received by customers who try it.  I'm currently signing up 2 paid customers a week with doing only tiny little bit of SEO and once a month sending a newsletter to my 3.5k mailing list.  My average MRR for single customer is about $200-250/mo (I expect it to be rising to $300-400/mo with time).  My product is decently sticky.  I expect customers to be hanging around for 2-3yrs, on the average.</p>

<p>My current overall MRR is still tiny however, since I started generating revenue in April and was stabilizing.</p>

<p>So, cutting to the chase: a non-direct competitor is looking to enter my space and wants to buy my product and probably my talent as well.  There are some good synergies and I would certainly welcome offloading some of my non-technical responsibilities on those who are more qualified.  Non-drect competitor is a younger company (10yrs or so), but they've received a decent-sized outside investment (to the tune of 25M) and want to rapidly expand.  I'm sure they could build a similar product, given enough time, money.  They also lack some of the SaaS knowledge and expertise that I could bring.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>How should I approach companies (giants like Microsoft, Deloitte, AT&amp;T etc.) to post job on my portal? Do I have to manually go to their offices and show power point slides or is there any easy way to convince them to join me?</p></li>
<li><p>I've almost zero money to do advertisement on medias like newspaper or TV which I believe attract users at the most. How can I possibly grow my user strength without that?

"6060","How to distribute equity in team in web based startup","<p>We are 4 guys in grad school. We are coders. I have an idea for a web based startup. So before starting the startup I want to distribute equity. <strong>I don't want 4 co-founders as too many cooks spoil the food</strong>. So I'll choose one of them to be co-founder.</p>

<p>So I have made two cases.</p>

<p><strong>CASE 1.</strong></p>

<p>B(Co-founder) - 20%</p>

<p>C- 10%</p>

<p>Me(Founder/CEO)- 50%</p>

<p>B(Co-founder) - 50%</p>

<p>C- ?</p>

<p>D- ?</p>

<p>Case 1 seems unfair. But I'll provide working space. And I will invest in web technologies like domain, hosting (as we are not going to produce any physical good). And top of all. This is my idea.</p>

<p>Case 2 is good to prevent any conflicts with co-founder in future but what about C and D. I can't pay them as we are in grad school.</p>

<p>Going forward 3 months, the other employee bailed, 1 co-founder decides to leave, and we're left with 2 co-founders and myself. During the last meeting, I learnt that their initial promise of getting a salary upon launching is no longer feasible, so instead they decided to bump my equity, and also wanted to break to employee/employer relationship to a <strong>partnership</strong> instead. We currently have no investors, though the co-founders found a lead on 1. In the near future, we're to dispose of the previous employer-employee agreement and sign a partnership instead.</p>

"6096","Comments and suggestions on my plan about starting up an online shopping store?","<p>I am web and specifically an e-commerce developer. I have so far developed a number of online shopping sites. I now want to make a store of my own however I am afraid of investing up a fair amount on initial grounds.</p>

<p>My site would hold about 250 products. According to my plan I will upload all the products with none of them in my physical inventory. As soon as I get an order of a certain product I will buy it from the market and ship it to the customer.</p>

<p>However I will buy one extra piece to stock it. For e.g. if a person orders Product-A on my site, I will verify the order and next I will go to the market and buy two pieces of Product-A, one to ship to the customer and one to stock in my physical store. In this way I will build an inventory of the products which are more frequently ordered. Once I gain a considerable sales volume I will start building my physical store.</p>

<p>This approach looks a bit weird but I have advantage of the wholesale-market which lies in my city so I will not have any problem visiting the market on every order. Also I will have a dedicated person who will buy the products from the market. In this way, I will not have to invest huge amounts to build a physical inventory prior to the online store and I will invest a greater share of my budget on SEO, online marketing and advertising.</p>

<p>My products are sports' goods with international shipping offered on all.</p>

<p>I've been building a website for the past few months that is basically a media sharing website, but it's tailored for a particular audience.  (As per most of these types of question, I'll be leaving the specifics out).</p>

<p>I'm looking at charging a very small amount (around £2 or $3 per month) for each member, primarily to cover the cost of the web server, and then hopefully further down the line it will cover my salary so I can take the project on full time and start to really make it grow.</p>

<p>The site is currently up and running, albeit still in the development phase, and I am about to release it to a group of beta testers in order to iron out any kinks, and identify any areas that need improving.</p>

<p>My real question is about the legalities of the whole thing.  I expect that an online subscription service has to be done ""by the book"", and I'm afraid I simply don't know where to start.</p>

<p>Any advice relating to this area will be very gratefully received, but any other pointers for a new starter would also be very helpful.</p>

"6106","User for Great Neural Network Library?","<p>I have invented a really powerful neural network training algorithm. The network can be trained in real time, requiring only about one millisecond per observation. Using the resulting neural network for prediction is extremely fast. This is with stock server hardware. The results are robust even if the data is noisy or it experiences concept drift. There is only one tunable parameter and its exact value is not critical. Even relatively non-technical users can get good results with the algorithm.</p>

<p>The original version of the code is in Haskell. I have been working on JavaScript and C++ versions. I believe it is patentable technology, though that is not a personal goal of mine. It should go without saying that it is the result of many years of experience with neural networks.</p>

<p>I do not have the financial means to launch a company to take advantage of this algorithm. I would love to see it put to good use. Even better, I would love to get paid to work on it. As a last resort, I plan on releasing the code as open source projects (GNU Affero GPL license). But I also need to put food on the table. I would love for somebody to step forward and help me turn it into a commercial product or to turn it into a new feature on an existing software product.</p>

<p>Any takers? Any ideas?</p>

<p>UPDATE 1: I was trying to be factual in the description of the code without getting too technical and without giving away too many details. What I was trying to say may have been open to misinterpretation as a result. I'm a practitioner (coder) with many years of experience. Writing research papers is just not something that I do. (i.e., no interest and no time).</p>

<p>The design goal of the code was to provide good results quickly via a very user friendly API. The robustness and concept drift features were added to make the code easier to use, if that makes sense. Researchers tend to care about 0.0001% better accuracy at the cost of days of runtime on a GPU. I did not set out to compete with them in any way.</p>

<p>I do not work in a lab. I work in the real world. I wrote the code for a specific commercial application. But I can see uses in many other settings. I have not come across any open source libraries that are even close to what I wrote. They tend to be toolkits for machine learning experts.</p>

<p>Several have suggested testing the code against MNIST. Looking into it. I already know the results would be good but not great. I know I cannot compete with an expert using an existing toolkit. But I'll bet my code could easily beat a non-expert using another toolkit. Hope that clears things up.</p>

<p>Here is some of the points I considering before coming to exact number ..
1. The amount that he is offering is what it requires to run the business for first ONE YEAR.</p>

<p>After 1 Year I want to go for big investment , I already spoke to an angel investor who agreed to invest if my business shows positive signs after one year of operation.</p>

<p>So My Concern here is I should not offer too much shares to my well wisher so if Angel Investor comes in , I am not able to offer him his share equal to his big money.</p>

<p>at the same time , because my partner believed me and the first person to come forward to help me , I should offer him enough of shares to him so that he could benefit in case our business grow according to our estimation </p>

<p>. Here is our business projection ( little optimistic , thou it not impossible )  </p>

<ol>
<li>For One Year Our Development and Maintenance cost for running business 
<strong>2 M</strong> which is equal to first investors contribution </li>
<li>We need min of 5 M to kick of marketing and business operation so that we can generate revenues ( this amount will be coming from an angel investor)</li>

<p>Lot of opensource projects start out as free so as to gain lot of users and so that creators can get lot of visibility within and outside their company, but when the projects start getting used a lot, many creators start their own companies which now charge money to fix all the problems caused by their opensource projects.</p>

<p>The other thing with a non-MS platform in today's world is that there are just too many choices to choose from esp. on the backend and in big-data processing. You pick anything and there will be some 20+ open source projects/technologies/databases to evaluate. It becomes overwhelming.</p>

<li>We have some connections and we know we could outsource our project</li>

<p>But we have one big problem: We lack of time and still are bound to other projects.</p>

<p>Now, we are from Germany and we would have to pay high wages to get someone with the potential to do our tasks. But this guy will sit next to us and we would have full control over him. Problem is, we only need him for the time of development, after that, we would have no task for him.</p>

<p>We also build up some contacts to partners outside of Germany, which are able to develop way cheaper, then we could do. (Think of it as: If I develop one hour on this project, i will loose one hour on an other, paid project. Which is about twice the amount, i would pay to our partner)</p>

<p>What would you suggest in such a situation? We have the capabilities, but also have way cheaper alternatives. We also only have few experience with outsourcing, but still are into the topic of web development, so we can distinguish between good and bad quality.</p>

<p>I am now not sure what to offer to him? I would not like to be rude and offer him too little, but at the same time I don't want to offer too much. </p>

<p>I was thinking to offer him a share of the startup. But how much of the share as it's a startup?</p>

<p>Also if I offer him a percentage of earning, I am not sure that he will accept it as he cannot be sure how much we earned. I usually use PayPal clients or freelancer websites so it's all uncertain for him to monitor (obviously I won't give him access to my paypal). </p>

<p>Another option is that I offer him some percentage on money he invested (like he's a bank), but in such case it would be better for me to take money from the bank as its interest rates may be lower. </p>

<p>EDIT</p>

<p>I am aware that startup means that the company will create ""something"" and place it on the market. In my case, startup is a new company created by myself which will employ dozens of developers to help me support all my client and shorten wait time. So maybe a startup is not the right word, but I don't know any other. </p>

<p>So although there is no any product to invest to, this person wants to help me create this company by paying its initial expenses and maybe salaries for some employees. In return, he expects to get something in return. </p>

<ol>
<li><p>I won't be physically present most of the time: I'll be running this company electronically (visiting only once or twice per year) until it grows to a sustainable size at which point I'll consider hiring staff and possibly moving myself</p></li>
<li><p>It must not be a so-called ""tax haven"" (there needs to be proper tax structures in place or it will cause problems for us locally)</p></li>
</ol>

<p>So, with that in mind...</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Which would be the easiest (and cost effective), stable 1st world countries to consider for setting up such a remote company?</p></li>
<li><p>Would it be possible to do this without having a physical address in any of said countries?</p></li>
<li><p>If not, would it be possible to set up a ""virtual office"" through a third party?</p></li>
</ul>

<p>One of the problems I'm trying to solve relates to the very common challenge that entities in certain countries can't register as Google Merchants (<a href=""https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/table/3539140?hl=en"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/table/3539140?hl=en</a>).</p>

<p>The other is that we need the company to operate under a more modern legal structure (such as under the EU, US, Oceanic, etc.)</p>

<p>I've looked into a number of options already, but laws keep on getting adjusted and updated to curb abuse - which is perfectly understandable - but unfortunately has the effect of blocking businesses wanting to set up foreign offices in a more cautious manner (i.e. by not hiring extra staff until it can be justified)</p>

<p>I've seen some other questions on this topic on SO, but they seem to relate more to ""tax restructuring"", which is not a consideration in our case</p>

<ul>
<li>The country involved would gain from the income tax (which we will gladly pay)</li>
<li>For us it would solve a great many problems</li>

<p>which adwiv was generous enough to answer.  I've done the research on my company, and there are 100,000,000 shares outstanding (number changed to protect the innocent :).  I got this information from:
 delecorp.delaware.gov/tin/GINameSearch.jsp  as suggested in the above post.</p>

<p>What does 100,000,000 shares outstanding really mean?  Are these shares spoken for (given to employees, sold to investors etc.)?   If the company was sold for 1 billion dollars, would each share be worth $10.00 (assuming no loans to be paid off), or are some of the shares ""not allocated""?</p>

<p>Also, if some of the shares were preferred shares, how would this change the calculation of what each share is worth.  Is there a way to figure out how many of the shares are preferred shares?  </p>

<p>By bottom line here is to figure out what my 50,000 options are worth.  I believe (I may be totally wrong!) that I can come up with an educated guess on how much someone might purchase the company for, but without knowledge as to what percent of the company each share is, it's hard to assign a value per share.</p>

<p>Thanks!
Dave</p>

<p>Update:  I got some extra information by going to the online chat at  delecorp.delaware.gov/tin/GINameSearch.jsp.  The common shares are 60,000,000 and the preferred shares are 40,000,000.</p>

<p>They were listed by the operator as:</p>

<p>COMMON 60,000,000   .001
PFD    40,000,000   .001</p>

<p>Does this give me any extra info?  How do preferred shares usually work?  My option price is about $0.50.  What is the preferred option/share price? Is there some standard formula (10X?)?   I guess I need to know how much is promised to each preferred share to be able to evaluate how much each common share is worth.  Correct?</p>

"6245","Broadcasting live with interactive shows without the host having to use video/audio?","<p>Here's my idea which is fairly simple, it is to create a broadcasting network with live 'shows' and channels like on TV, YouTube and radio. However, here's the difference, the host is not talking live on air like on radio, nor are they talking to a camera, they are communicating simply by typing, exactly like a chat room which allows people to come and go as they please. During my show I'll be able to share and broadcast video and audio as part of a live show. The audience are not able to disrupt the show however they are invited to continue messaging the host and even share links to whatever website or video clip they like, as these would be selected by the host to share with all of the audience whenever they like. The host can 'switch on' interactive features during the show which would give one or more guests in the 'audience' the ability to participate in the show in many different ways ranging from live 'radio show' type audio broadcasts to even interactively presenting things as if they were on stage in a theatre! </p>

<p>The difference between this and social networking websites is you can tune in without registering a profile or without having to establish your own profile just to tune in to my channel. You don't participate in the discussion until the host chooses to allow this feature to grant access to any live discussions which may even allow anyone to post anything on the public live feed / wall. Facebook has pretty much all of the tools to do this but it completely ringfences the 'audience' by restricting access to registered members only and then requires being a 'member' of a group or page which again is exactly the reason why I am asking this question to see if there is an obvious existing solution that would give me a reason not to reinvent the wheel; could you please advise how I would find such a website or app that would give me an easy way of broadcasting my own channel in these ways? If not, I'll get on with the 'show' and continue developing this new platform as a tool to do all of the above in exactly the right way it is intended to be delivered. Many thanks.</p>

I am still learning how to program but there is never a point where you know everything. Anyways, I need to bring aboard some people that know what they are doing and would be willing to take some equity in the company rather than a payment because I don't have a lot of money to shell out to talented developers.</p>

<p>Is there a place to find people seeking a position in a startup or is there a place to find such people? None of my friends are programmers otherwise I would just have them come aboard my team and help me out but they are not into that kind of thing so I need to find some freelancers that would want to take equity in my startup instead of pay. </p>

<p>Is there a place to find people that are willing to do that or is it better develop as much as I can then pay somebody to come aboard? In my experience equity is just as valuable a payment as money because of the potential that such an application has. What would you guys suggest?</p>

<ul>
<li>there are already alternatives of the same app in the app store that more successful</li>
<li>there current number of user is ridiculously small so they will never ever make some money with ads</li>

<p>This would mean that either </p>

<ul>
<li>a user has to click about 30 times on an ad, which seems quite too much for me, or </li>
<li>that a user is worth about 15$ when selling the users data. Following <a href=""http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/2/927ca86e-d29b-11e2-88ed-00144feab7de.html#axzz2z2agBB6R"">this</a> link, a user is approx. worth about 0.5$ or</li>
<li>that the users are willing to buy some kind of fee to use the app, which covers the 15$... but why should they if there exists a better and more successful app?</li>
</ul>

<p>I also know about a geo fencing app where several clones exist in the app store but still the developers received a few million dollars.</p>

<p>At this point, I am pre-beta, and need help to get it polished enough for initial beta test. And would like them to stay on post beta if the idea proves viable. I don't have investors at this point, so I can't really afford to pay my resources. I've found three resources (a dev, designer, and UX designer) who are coworkers of mine at my current job, and because of our good rapport, they seem willing to do pro bono work. </p>

<p>I am sure, however, that they'd like an idea of when they'll start getting compensated. So given my lack of funds until I have investors, I am trying to create an equity plan of x% after we do our successful beta.</p>

<p>I am new to running my own team, so I am looking for guidance on:</p>

<ul>
<li>templates for contracts related to equity compensation </li>
<li>guides for appropriate % of equity</li>
<li>when ""equity"" should kick in...</li>
<li>since it's pre-beta, perhaps I shouldn't even consider ""equity"" until we do a litmus beta test to gauge its viability? Perhaps just keep it a light fun side-project for now?</li>
</ul>

<p>My Research: I've found some good resources, such as <a href=""http://firstround.com/review/The-Right-Way-to-Grant-Equity-to-Your-Employees/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">WealthFront</a>, which provide good tips on equity plans, and this tool to show percentages based on level.

<p>I believe that equity is a good choice because it's more motivating to them to have the product succeed so they get compensated... but ""equity"" is meaningless until we create revenue, of which I am unsure how to generate at this early stage.</p>

That platform is an iOS app that helps customers find businesses and helps businesses bring more  customers. The features are awesome and there's so much the system is capable of doing. 
The Business model is a free app for all users, but would cost a business owner to show up on it. 
I am biased of course, but the professionals that I met, and discussed this with, also think there's a good potential here.<br>
My problem is, that I built it alone, and I am a single founder. 
I made it all. code, animations, website. Everything. Going through all of the businesses is possible but too much for a single person to do. So, I thought to simply start locally at a neighbourhood near my home. </p>

<p>Years back I started a big project with a friend, which became a nightmare, and ever since then, I find it hard to trust people, so I built my own project by myself.</p>

<p>I was told that finding an investor when you are a single founder could be a problem. </p>

<p>I have a great product, I don't have a team. I was working for several years on this project. I don't know how to go on from here. I have a foundation for a test pilot. I got businesses to register (free of charge, of course) and show up on the system. Most of them asked me how much it costs, and many told me it seems like a good system.</p>

<p>I deeply believe users will find the app useful, as it gives them so much. Not only benefits, but also info about where they are and what's around them.</p>

<p>I am perplexed. I have not enough funds to move far beyond that pilot, and at this point I would like to bring more people in (Marketing, R&amp;D, Graphics), but I don't have anything to give other than shares in the company, stock options or guarantee for payment in the future. 
Not sure what to do... </p>

<p>I'll be honest, I'm no expert and I don't have a tech background but have been working for a startup for the last 7-8 months, doing a bit of marketing/sales/logistics/client relationship/project and operations management etc</p>

<p>Anyway, ever heard of the apps '5miles', 'Offer up' and 'Let go'? </p>

<p>They are both apps that act as a market place to enable one sell their second hand goods. Free service. You take a picture of what you want to sell, post it online. I send you a message saying 'is item x still available? Would you accept $50 for it? You reply 'Yes' and we arrange to meet up in the parking lot at McDonald's for the exchange.</p>

<p>If you go on the GooglePlay/app store you'll come across at least 10 apps like this. All free, all doing the same thing and are all pretty average and basic.</p>

<p>'Let go' just got funded for $100m by South African based NASPERS - how can an app like this get $100m of funding? For a free service? Are they going to somehow start charging a fee once they've built up a customer base? Are they going to sell user information? Pop up ads on the app?</p>

<p>5miles just ran a 3 month campaign on the radio which cost $250k (which surely means they are funded?) - I recently used the app to purchase a set of golf clubs at a price which I thought was a good deal. I met this little old lady in an IHOP parking lot.</p>

<p>I mean, $100m?! Surely not.</p>

<p>Obviously I wasn't there when the CEO gave his pitch, I don't know what % stake the VC's took of each company and I don't know what plans for expansion the company might have in the future. </p>

<p>I guess if a huge company like NASPERS (You probably won't have heard of them, but go a quick Google) invests in them, I guess they know something that I don't.</p>

<p>Most VC's would look to at least make 2-3 times their investment back? NASPERS must see some serious potential if they invested $100m. </p>

<p>Say, I reach an investor and claim that my mobile app has 10,000 registered users. Is he/she going to ask me to provide a list of users perhaps with their email addresses?

Let's say that in my target market there are 10 million potential users. I know that all of them reasonably can benefit from using the application but there's no way to guarantee any minimum number of users. It's a completely new product in the market, so there's few ""current interests"" in the concept with which to base my argument. I have about a dozen responses from potential users but that's not a big enough pool to determine an average.</p>

<p>My thoughts are that I could be ultra-conservative with my numbers. e.g. ""even if we only get this many users, we can still reach this target."" but I don't want to turn them off with small numbers. I also really don't want to pitch the idea of high numbers and then get the question ""What happens if we fund you and virtually no one utilizes this application?""</p>

"7453","Enticing Contract Conditions for Key Accounts","<p>I'm a partner in a tiny software startup (an advanced portfolio management system for investment companies) and we are getting interest from several medium-sized companies ready to buy our product.</p>

<p>These would be key accounts in the sense that they would increase our visibility by referral and of course increase revenue as well, which at this point in time is quite useful, although we already reached actual break-even. They all like the system very much, but the fact that we are newly established is a problem since if we disappear their investment is gone. Entirely gone in case of bankruptcy or our long-term servicing might degrade in case of a buy-out. Migration to a new system in this industry is a major deal, so they all know they better get the right one.</p>

<p>We are open to talk about ""special conditions"" in our contracts, but for now we haven't found anything acceptable for us. For example, one company asked for an equity stake, one for an equity swap, two others a seat on the board, another requested that we put our source code in escrow.</p>

<p>We fully understand their concern, but we can't give equity or board seats to clients mainly because their competitors (the rest of our market) would immediately lose interest in the system. Plus, it would be smart to retain as much equity as possible for potential major opportunities down the line, rather than ""sacrificing"" it for a single client.</p>

<p>As for the escrow idea, we are afraid of making a mistake in the contract that could leave us vulnerable and loose everything. So something less drastic would be preferred.</p>

"7469","Would Green Card give much advantage to do business in the US?","<p>I am currently in the US on H1B visa and I am working for a tech company in California. Since my Priority Date is current I could get a green Card in 6 months, if I really wanted to.</p>

<p>However, my mid-term plans are to go back home to Europe where I have a really awesome team with which to kick off a software project and work full time on it.</p>

<p>Now I have to make decision, whether:</p>

<ol>
<li>to wait these 6 months and get the green card before going back to Europe; or</li>
<li>to abandon my green card application (and also H1B status with my current employer) before going back to Europe.</li>
</ol>

<p>My question #1 is - <strong>what are pros and cons of getting the green card now if I plan to start my own business that in the future might need to expand into the US?</strong> For example:</p>

<ol>
<li>Would it be simpler to raise funding in the US for my startup if I had green card?</li>
<li>Would it be simpler to do business in the US if I had green card (finding marketing people, selling service to the US entities etc)  </li>
<li>Would I have to and would it be simpler to incorporate company or branch in the US if I had a green card?</li>
<li>Any other reasons to get a green card to do businesses?</li>
</ol>

<p>My questions #2 is - <strong>if I don't get the green card now and simply go back to Europe how hard would it be to get back to the US if my business will eventually need to expand here</strong> (ie. how hard would it be to get an entrepreneur-type visa)?</p>

<p>The company hasn't raised any money yet, but is looking to do so. What I'm interested in is some equity. He hasn't made me the full time CTO yet because I can't commit it to that just yet, given he can't afford to pay me a salary yet.

<p>I would like to put it into the wild but know it needs a few things added.</p>

<p>Crash protection encapsulation.</p>

I'm looking for a time and cost quote for the enhancements to my Android application in order to know what to offer the ""one shot"" Developer (in shares) that would be reasonable to both parties.  </p>

"7552","What tools and software are used to create a new social network?","<p>I have an idea. It is a pretty simple idea, it something I need and I cannot find on internet, and I believe that  people around the world need it. 
That said, I can find on internet very similar web sites to the one I have in mind, but they provide different services from the one I want. </p>

<p>The social network has two different users: those who give the service (retailers) and those who use the service (customers).  Structurally, it is very similar to airbnb or uber or many many websites. It does not need (for the moment) of a mobile app or heavy data analysis, but just social networking. So, I think there are tons of software already ready to create this website. I can develop software, so I'd like to create an alpha of the website before looking for partners. <strong>What software and which kind of hosting service do I need to build such a website?</strong>
This is a preliminary list of thinks that (I guess) have to be done:</p>

<ul>
<li>Find the right hosting service (<em>Do I need of AWS-like services or a standard hosting service with php+mysql could be enough?</em>) </li>
<li>A possible way to manage suggestions can be through neo4j.</li>
<li>Manage multiple languages  (<em>is there a specific software for this?</em>). in particular I would start with my local language and English and eventually cover the most frequent languages.</li>
<li>I thought to use PayPal as the simplest way to allow customers to pay for the service, and then the website to pay the retailers.</li>
<li>what language should I use to develop the server-side website? (<em>php, node.js, ruby on rails, python?)</em> I have no idea. </li>
<li>Buy a domain</li>
</ul>

<p>I believe the smarter way to start is finding a something already developed for this kind of websites. </p>

<p><strong>Does exist a software that, like WordPress for blogs, allows to create a social-network quickly and efficiently?</strong> </p>

<p><strong>So my question is:</strong> What implicit usage rules are typical in free software, especially software that is collaborated on between 2 or more groups/companies. For example, I wasn't able to find a ""Google &amp; W3C Terms and Conditions for Speech Technology"" doc.</p>

<p>I just find it hard to believe that so much work went in to creating their speech technology (recording narrations, algorithms for understanding/interpreting speech, etc), that I wouldn't be giving up some rights by using their software. </p>

<p>I'd just like to fully understand what I am agreeing to by using this.</p>

It was pointed out to me that this site is a better place for it. The following text is the original question.</p>

<hr>

<p>I am planning on registering a business in Canada in the near future.
I am developing a tool, the longterm goal of which is to improve conditions in impoverished areas of the world. However, this tool is made in a way that it will be useful to people living in the first world countries. </p>

<p>I will need funding, and there can be no talk about profit before my business reaches a critical mass of users. Even after it does, I don't yet see streams of revenue.</p>

<p>The plan is not to make money off this tool, but to have enough income to provide this tool to the public and be able to invest in it's further development. That comes down to about less than $50,000 for the first year.</p>

<p>The choice I am gravitating towards is registering a not-for-profit organization. But I'm wondering:</p>

<ul>
<li>Are there some obstacles that will make it harder to register and run a not-for-profit business than a for-profit business?</li>
<li>Is it going to be harder to find funding as a not-for-profit?</li>
</ul>

Yet, There really doesn't seem to be any good, <strong>easy to understand</strong> guides out there to plan for server costs. Of course, a ""fit all"" algorithm to finding the costs is no easy task because of all the possible variables that can affect the estimation(what does you app do, which cloud platform do you chose, etc).</p>

<p>With that said, does anyone has a go to guide?</p>

<li>Figure out how much data a user download per day in Mbs</li>
<li>Figure out how much data a user upload per day in Mbs</li>
<li>Estimate how many hours per week your server will run a maximum traffic</li>
<li>Estimate your maximum traffic</li>
<li>Chose a cloud platform(probably needs steps to chose one...)</li>
<li>Based on your platform choice, estimate the price per month per quantum of users(I say quantum because I assume the price doesn't vary in a linear fashion with the number of users).</li>

"7748","What would be a fair and reasonable agreement for equity and franchise fee when launching operation in a new country?","<p>I went to #websummit and bumped into a lot of people / startups / opportunities. One of the opportunities was exceptionally appealing - we met after hours, we had a productive conversation, we both agreed to find a <strong>reasonable and fair arrangement regarding finances and equity</strong>.</p>

<h2>I don’t have much experience when negotiating such deals.</h2>

<p>My strategy is to ""lay cards on the table"" - explain my current situation, expectations, needs of myself and other party to find something that will keep us happy, engaged, motivated, satisfied.</p>

<p>The product is ""Uber for X”:</p>

<ul>
<li>I genuinely believe in the idea</li>
<li>Market is ready for it</li>
<li>It solves an authentic problem</li>
<li>It scratches my own itch <em>(and many other folks in my demographics)</em></li>
</ul>

<p>My intention is to work on this project for 3-5 years and make decent return of investment.</p>

<p>The original founding team is roughly 10 timezones apart. I offered them my full dedication to launch UK operations:</p>

<ul>
<li>regulatory compliance</li>
<li>legal entity, taxes, certifications, insurance</li>
<li>health and safety (this is huge in the UK)</li>
<li>getting the thing off the ground and scale, scale, scale, scale...</li>
</ul>

<p>The original founding team is fully bootstrapped and owns 100% equity. I didn’t earn any rights to it but longer term I would like to have some percentage points. Reason for that - I am competent and experienced person - I am fully convinced that by working side by side for a few years I will significantly increase value of the company.</p>

<p>Since I’ll be using their technology it feels like the “mothership” should be eligible for some <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franchise_fee"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franchise_fee</a></p>

<p>Yet another option (that I’d rather avoid it) is to rip off the idea and create my own platform. Personally I don’t like it as it would take me a while to build it from scratch and even then I would remain vulnerable to other copycats.</p>

<hr>

<p>So the question remains - what is the <strong>reasonable and fair arrangement regarding finances and equity</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li>some percentage points?</li>
<li>some franchise fee?</li>
<li>shall ""mothership"" own equity in the UK branch?</li>
</ul>

<p>Maybe some of you know Uber / Groupon “franchise” model and how they solved issue of spreading out to other countries / cities? Such experience would be invaluable for me… Literally - I’m betting my next 3-5 years and I want to do this right - your advice will be greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>I believe that in 2015 this should be a common knowledge but still - I cannot find much information on the internet and need to crowdsource it... Even if your advice is “talk to a lawyer” by asking question now I’ll be better prepared to the conversation.</p>

"7764","What equity can I expect as a first employee of a startup?","<p>So, I graduated from college about 6 months back and have been working in a pretty big company (in fact the leading ecommerce company in my country) for about 4 months. The work is not very challenging or interesting right now but the team is very good and the environment is pretty relaxed. I am not dissatisfied with my job.</p>

<p>Two of my batchmates who had been working on an idea for about a year and half recently managed to raise seed funding of about $100,000 at a valuation of $1 million or so I am told.</p>

<p>Because of the time they have put into the startup they don't have a degree yet and don't seem like getting one in near future but do seem dedicated towards the startup.</p>

<p>Anyways they are offering me 2% equity and the same salary as my current job and the position of CTO (Personally with me being the only tech guy at the moment I'm not sure if the title means much). The offer at the moment is up for negotiation.</p>

<p>Currently one of the cofounders is working as the sole tech guy but if and when I join the company, I'll have that responsibility with the cofounders busy in raising the next round.</p>

<p>Considering what's at stake here, with me leaving my first company less than a year and the only guy with a degree (whose significance may vary from person to person) I'm not sure I'm getting a fair enough deal.</p>

<p>I'm not entirely comfortable working under my batchmates as just an employee. If I'm leaving such a comfortable position, it doesn't make sense for me to join a company just as an employee. I would like to help run the startup as well. But who apart from cofounders can run the startup? At the same time they have been at it for almost two years and managed to raise funding on their own. So, it doesn't make sense to ask to be made a cofounder, if that's even a possibility. Or is this request actually fair?</p>

<p>So, what are my options here? Increasing equity probably makes sense? If so, how much equity can I expect?</p>

<p>Is there any other way where I can stop being just an employee? Is it fair to be ask to be made a cofounder? Do I have any other options?</p>

<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>Edit:
I read up a few answers on equity distribution and a lot of them focus on the risk factor. I think it is arguable to say that I am taking a big risk leaving my job less than 6 months (which might reflect poorly on my resume) as compared to the founders themselves who have not got much to lose. They can always continue with their education in case of the worst scenario. Of course this is opinion based and hence I have used the word arguable.</p>

However, this is my first business endeavor (no experience with building a company or a website) and I'm a young guy, so people are less likely to take me seriously. But I think this idea could have value to many people and I want to try. </p>

<p><strong>My idea in a nutshell</strong>:</p>

<p>It's basically a site to find professionals to answer your question and you pay them for it. The users pay via iFrames (Braintree) and if they are satisfied by the professional's expertise, they click a button and that professional gets paid. I am currently attempting to integrate Braintree's iFrames into my Wordpress site.</p>

<p>I've heard advice that I shouldn't start a website that involves payments as my first try at a business/website in general because of a few key reasons:</p>

<ol>
<li>I won't be able to keep it secure, nor have the means to pay an I.T. company to secure it</li>
<li>I won't have the ability to deal with lawsuits should they occur</li>
<li>Lack of web dev experience will lead to a mediocre website</li>
</ol>

<p>But keeping my idols in mind, I don't think I should be phased by this. There are a lot of people who start websites that involve payment info and yes a lot fail, but why is that any reason to not try?</p>

<p>What do people think about this? Am I an idiot for trying to start a website that involves payments by myself? What are the risks and what could be the worst outcomes of all this? </p>

<p>Google's employment agreement, like <a href=""http://stimmel-law.com/fr/article/who-owns-employees-inventions-made-home"" rel=""nofollow"">those of many other companies</a>, stipulates that Google owns any intellectual property you develop while employed by Google, even if you do so using only your own time and equipment, and without using any Google proprietary information.</p>

<p>California provides a partial exemption from that rule in <a href=""http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/displaycode?section=lab&amp;group=02001-03000&amp;file=2870-2872"" rel=""nofollow"">California Labor Code Section 2870</a>, in that the above...</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>...shall not apply to an invention that the employee developed entirely on his or her own time without using the employer's equipment, supplies, facilities, or
  trade secret information except for those inventions that [...] relate at the time of conception or reduction to practice of the invention to the employer's business, or actual or demonstrably anticipated research or development of the employer</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>However, because Google's business interests, especially anticipated ones, are so wide and varied, the employment agreement clause is likely to apply to <em>any</em> personal project.</strong></p>

<p>Google does have a <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1969979"" rel=""nofollow"">process to grant you copyright of your work</a> but for open source projects. What if you don't release the code as open source?</p>

<p>How can a Google employee try out a startup idea (that genuinely does not compete with Google's interests), at home on weekends, without fearing legal action from Google? Some considerations:</p>

<ul>
<li>even if a court would favor the employee, battling Google in court is cost-prohibitive</li>
<li>while Google may not be in the startup's market now, they may enter it in the future</li>
<li>even if Google isn't in the business of suing random startups, if a genuinely non-competing startup employing a Googler becomes successful, Google may still claim rights</li>
</ul>

<p>Is this a reason why <a href=""https://www.quora.com/Why-have-so-few-successful-startups-come-out-of-Google/answer/James-Demetrios"" rel=""nofollow"">so few successful startups have come out of Google compared with other companies</a>?</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong></p>

<p>Found <a href=""https://www.quora.com/Can-I-make-my-own-company-while-still-working-at-Google-full-time"" rel=""nofollow"">this discussion on Quora</a> and <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1970226"" rel=""nofollow"">this YCombinator comment from ~2010</a> that mentions</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""a process called the IARC (Invention Assignment Review Committee) where you can submit a description of your work, and if your submission is accepted, you get an assurance from Google that it won't try to claim ownership of it""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It would be nice to see <em>someone who represents Google</em> address this question. Consider a candidate who got an offer from Google but wants to work on a side project off-duty. Based on publicly available information, the candidate may consider declining the offer if they think they would get in legal trouble by working on the side project. You can see this concern expressed in the <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1969979"" rel=""nofollow"">Hacker News thread</a> I linked to above.</p>

<p>If Google actually is not evil and has a process by which they can grant some forms of IP exemption, it would be Google's loss to not mention that.</p>

<p>The reason why I ask, is that people probably had good(or bad ideas thinking they're good) and went the same route, so someone knows what are the steps of creating a internet company from everything like hiring/firing to setting a milestones for your company, delegating instead of micromanaging, putting the money where it makes more money (advertising), and all that business side to the business that somebody with tech background might not think it's important but it's really driving the business forward or backward.</p>

<p>I mean having an awesome architecture and code in your app is worthless unless somebody buys into your vision of the app, which might involve people buying subscription or whatever the business model is. Even after initial success of selling your product you need to know what comes next after 12-18 months down the road, and having someone to advise you or having someone that you can talk with these things is a great asset, instead of learning everything on your own as you build your business, team etc. Also investor money helps with advertising, hiring etc.</p>

<p>We've been informally advised by trademark lawyers that their case does not have much merit, but a formal response to their lawyer's letter will cost us upwards of £1,000/$1,500k. As a bootstrapped business we can just about afford this - but I'm concerned that if we open a legal dialog these costs will spiral out of control.</p>

<p>How best should we proceed? I've been advised that we shouldn't ignore this, but I'm not sure that a letter from me (a programmer!) is enough to deter them. It seems a shame to give in to what seems like frivolous litigation, but without a budget of many thousands of dollars, I'm struggling to see any other option. </p>

<p>From above site, it seems that there are</p>

<li>GSM Modem </li>
<li>Eload SIM card</li>
</ol>

<p>I'm not familiar with any prepaid reload solution, but I am coming from a hardware and software design background. As $$$ is constrained, I need to make sure that should I proceed to do RnD, I'm heading to the right direction.</p>

<p>From the system referred, I assume the GSM modem will have many port to put multiple SIM card? The SIM card is specific and special for each carrier provider, means I have to register a number from each carrier and deposit a certain amount of credit to it. Lets say I want to support for 10 provider, I register 10 different number with each. Then, I register another number so as to act as a point of contact@middleman to my system. People will send SMS to this number with different command eg. 0123456789.M10 where {targetReloadHp}.{providerSuffix}{Amount}). Then, either:</p>

<p><strong>A)</strong> Upon receiving it, the GSM modem will send the command to PC, PC will check balance from Eload SIM card and if credit is enough PC analyze the command and instruct 1 of the 10 SIM card to transfer balance to target Hp...</p>

<p><strong>B)</strong> Upon receiving it, send the command to Eload SIM card. Eload SIM card analyze the command and check the credit balance, and then if credit sufficient send back the command to PC and PC will analyze the command and instruct 1 of the 10 SIM card to transfer balance to target Hp</p>

<p>Not sure whether a) or b). If b), seems that I need to write firmware and bootloader for Eload? </p>

<p>Is this the correct flow?</p>

<p>a) or b) or the whole concept is wrong altogether? Are there any reference design? Are there any communication protocol that I need to follow? For example, I saw  ETSI GSM 07.05 mentioned in below site. But if I dont use phone, it means it doesnt apply to my case since I'm using GSM modem?</p>

<p>How can founder A fire founder B if B does not have a employment contract? By ""fire"" I mean stop the vesting of B.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: Here is wording from a draft shareholder agreement:</p>

<p><em>Forfeiture of unvested Shares</em>: In the event that engagement by the Company of the Employee or Director ceases during the Vesting Period (Forfeiting Shareholder), any unvested Shares shall be forfeited and transferred back to the Company (at nominal value only).</p>

<p><em>Bad Leaver</em>: In the event that engagement by the Company of the Employee or Director ceases during the Vesting Period as a Bad Leaver, the Forfeiting Shareholder may also be required to transfer all vested Shares on written notice any time before 12 months after the end of the Vesting Period.</p>

<p>Where such transfer is required by the Company, the consideration payable for those Shares shall be the lesser of nominal value and the subscription price paid for the Shares.</p>

<p>I am involved in the process of drafting a contract. They want to give me the 10% of company but only on event of the company exit.</p>

<p>What should I keep in mind when drafting or reviewing this portion of a contract?</p>

<p>Also, I spend already many years with the company and would like to keep that 10% as an option even if I leave a company after few years. Say I leave them after 5 years but 1 year later they got sold.</p>

<p>Some ideas / questions:</p>

<ul>
<li>I've read about accelerated vesting on exit. I was thinking that this can be used to vest equity in 'change of control' or IPO.</li>
<li>Perhaps it would be better to use options instead of equity, since company is reluctant to give away 10% shares before the exit. My thinking is that receiving options that can be cashed in the event of exit means I can keep them even if I leave the company. </li>

"7982","Issues with leaving 'co-founder'","<p>We were three guys.  Me and a friend had been working (part-time) on a software product for 1.5 years when another guys joined.  In a meeting we discussed to split things up evenly.  Nothing was put on paper nor even email.</p>

<p>A few months later my friend lost interest in the project.  The late joiner, who had spent his spare time working on the project, was disappointed, lost hope, and stopped working.</p>

<p>The late joiner told me that he would be interested again if I found a replacement for my friend.  I was outraged because of his lack of willingness to make this thing work.  Almost literally the joiners position was: I'll do 50/50 again if you manage to find a solution.</p>

<p>We're half a year later now.  I've worked hard on the product, found another person that is a great replacement for my friend.  Because the late joiner still has software he worked on, I had a meeting with him to discuss how we could get hold of that.</p>

<p>In this meeting the joiner was still saying that 1/3 belonged to him because we said this earlier.  Even though I spent 5x more time &amp; effort plus thousands in logo design, web-hosting, software outsourcing, that all ideas were coming from my friend &amp; me (not from him), and that he didn't do a thing for many months; he still thought it was perfectly logical that he was part of this.</p>

<p>Because I don't want him to keep any share, given his total lack of interest &amp; entrepreneurship (leaving me to fix things on my own), I proposed to pay him in royalties until he'd be paid back very generously.  He did not like my proposal of 100k (for his 1.5 months of work), and wanted 10 million.  This made clear that I would never want to work with him again.</p>

<p>Current status is that the joiner did not respond to my email asking to give me a test version of the software, for me to estimate the value.  That piece of software (worth perhaps 1.5 full-time work month) is his only contribution, which he is now holding back.  He has not responded for weeks.</p>

<p>So again it's gone completely silent.  BTW, I had to ping him to start the discussion about getting hold of his work after totally no interest nor contact from him for months.  The fact that he's not willing to relinquish his work is actually frustration progress, because we need to find someone else to get this work done again.</p>

He had his lawyer draw up a contract and a couple of things are making me nervous. I'm new to the startup world so maybe these are standard. Please advice!</p>

<li>No Founder shall receive any salary or other compensation for services rendered to the Company as a Founder or otherwise, except as otherwise agreed upon in writing by the Founders.  </li>

<li>All provisions of this agreement are fully severable.</li>

<p>This means he can change his mind anytime, say after I have worked for 11 months and sever the contract (I have a year cliff in my vesting schedule). I thus get nothing for 11 months of work.</p>

<p>Now, although I have the programming knowledge to build the app, my main doubt has been on how to choose which app to build.</p>

<p>In other words, we write software to solve problems, so the point here is that if I want to build and start selling a software I need a problem to be solved. And this problem must be something which people are interested in.</p>

<p>The point is that I have not been able to see a problem that needs solving that hasn't been addressed before. For some time I believe this was just a question of creativity: if I don't have it, I don't have it and there's nothing that can be done. However, lately I've seem many new startups every month and so I wonder if there is some kind of research, some kind of line of thought that might lead to some problem that needs solving through software.</p>

<p>In that case, how to identify a problem that can be solved through the creation of some app? Is there some kind of research, line of thought or anything else that might lead us to find some problems that we can approach, so that we can select one to build an app?</p>

"8109","Fairness of Stock Options Changes from Offer Letter","<p>I'm currently working at my first startup (~20 people) out of grad school, and there were significant changes in my offered options from my offer letter until actually receiving them formally (through an online agreement by <a href=""https://www.esharesinc.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.esharesinc.com/</a>)</p>

<p>I'm trying to assess whether this is normal, or way out of line. I'm feeling pretty frustrated and distrustful of my startup's leadership right now.</p>

<p>In my offer letter, I was given 18,000 stock options at $0.282 per share, vesting over 4 years with a 1 year cliff. The offer letter included the phrase ""the price of your options may vary slightly if the company updates its share price between now and the time your options are Board-approved"".</p>

<p>I didn't formally receive my stock options for 6.5 months. I asked a few times in the first two months where my options agreement was, but the CEO said he needed a board meeting to approve the options. I know there was a few board meetings from the time I started until I finally got the options. One detail that may be relevant is that the company closed a Series B a month after I received the options, so perhaps there was some sort of financial shake-up?</p>

<p>When I finally received the options, the amount and price was different from my offer letter, now at:
18,500 at $0.38 per share</p>

<p>I asked why there was a difference, and my CEO said the increase from 18,000 to 18,500 was to make up for the increase in share price. Assuming what he called a ""409A price"" (the supposed actual price the investors pay) of $4:
(# of options)*(Share Price - Option Price)
So, respectively:
* Offer Letter value:   $66924.00
* Formally Given value: $66970.00
(A $54 increase)</p>

<p>This made sense to me at the time. I mean, this is my first time at a startup, and I am naive, so I'm implicitly trusting the startup leadership. The CEO assured me that what I got was actually better than the offer letter.</p>

<p>However, a few months later, after attending an info session, I put it together that that new option price is going to cost me significantly more money:
Original cost: $0.282 x 18,000 = $5075.9
New cost:      $0.38  x 18,500 = $7030.0</p>

<p>So, yes, I feel stupid at this point for taking a few months to realize this. I have an undergrad degree in math, but despise doing finances or taxes, so I typically let an accountant deal with it. And I typically err on the side of trusting people whose interests are supposed to be aligned with mine.</p>

<p>But what the leadership of my company did is change an offer to something of slightly higher value ($54 more! meh?) at a significantly increased cost (nearly $2000, wtf!?).</p>

<p>Questions:</p>

<p>0) Is there anything wrong with my calculations?</p>

<p>1) Is it normal to wait this long to get your options formally?</p>

<p>2) What requires the company to change the options cost? Why not offer the options at the original amount from my letter? It seems like they're hitting up employees for fundraising. They don't seem to be in a poor financial position.</p>

<p>3) Do I have a valid complaint here, whether or not there is legal recourse?</p>

<p>Right now, I'm looking for clarity before I bring this up with the leadership. I don't feel trusting of them, and significantly outgunned.</p>

<p>At first when he told me about it he was planning to hire external companies to do the job and the technology - which I imagine it is very expensive- . </p>

<p>Now, as I know how the technology works and I actually know how to develop the idea, I proposed him to partner in the idea.</p>

<p>At first he loved the idea and discussed it with me. As I said , he is not a technical person and he will not take part of the code. If any,he would be giving the ideas.</p>

<p>As I feel that the idea is great, I was thinking about leaving my job and work full time on the idea.My offer was that he would not need to pay me.</p>

<p>Now, what he offered me is a 10% which I feel is not what I deserve.</p>

<p>I understand he will be making the initial investment.But I also believe that doing so does not mean that he needs to own 90% of the company when I'll do all the technical work.</p>

<p>On the one hand , It is a true that he will be doing all the bussines related like meeting with investors and so on- and that my monetary investment would be $0.</p>

<p>On the other hand , I'll risk a lot more time than he would,I'll do all the technical work and I'll leave my current work to be focused. He is planning to stay at his current job</p>

There are many jobs that I do currently, some of which I'm going to delegate sooner or later. There may be other jobs I don't know about yet that I should be doing, or that I should hire someone to do.  Please help me fill in the list of necessary elements for a small online entertainment business!</p>

<p>The current state: I make short, funny videos based on comments and questions that viewers leave on my earlier videos. So every day I spend several hours reading and replying to viewer comments, and I keep a list of all my favorite questions, along with a ranking so I can know which ones to shoot first.</p>

<p>Each day when I shoot a video, I pick a question, and write a loose script with about 10 jokes based on the question. Then I set up my simple video camera and homemade lighting kit in my apartment in Los Angeles, CA, USA, and I make jokes based on the question for about 10-20 minutes.</p>

<p>I use Adobe Premiere CC to edit the video down to 2-3 minutes. That process takes 1-3 hours, and may involve finding royalty-free images to use in the video. Using Adobe Photoshop CC, I create a thumbnail image for the video, which is like a miniature movie poster. That's a 15-minute process.  Then I upload the video to YouTube and add a title, description of the video, and tags (another 15-20 minutes).</p>

<p>Once a month I receive a SMALL electronic deposit of my income from YouTube. (How that works: I allow YouTube to place ads on my videos, and YouTube pays me 55% of their ad royalties in return.) About 3 times a month I need to buy a prop for my videos, but other than that my videos are essentially free to make.</p>

<p>Here are the job responsibilities that I think I'm doing:</p>

<ul>
<li>public relations (interacting with viewers via their comments)</li>
<li>joke writer / screenwriter</li>
<li>on-screen talent</li>
<li>video editor</li>
<li>""artist"" (for the thumbnail images)</li>
</ul>

<p>There are some other things I'd like to add to my business. I'm not going to ""name"" the role, since I don't clearly understand the titles of the people who should be doing these things:</p>

<ul>
<li>I would like to accelerate the spread of awareness of my videos, my YouTube channel, and me as an ""online personality"".</li>
<li>I'd like a more efficient way of interacting with my viewers, the comments they leave on videos, and the direct messages they sometimes send.</li>
<li>I want to make sure the community of viewers stays friendly with each other, and grows synergistically.</li>
<li>I need a website person to build out my associated website, keep it up to date, and add new fun features &amp; games (that I suggest) for visitors.</li>
<li>I'd like to bring in more income from the business.  (I'm thinking t-shirts and other merch.  There are probably other non-merchandise means as well.)</li>
<li>I'll need someone to keep track of income, expenses, taxes, etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>Are there any roles or responsibilities that I'm missing? Are there any responsibilities you would split, or set up differently, or delegate / outsource?</p>

<p>The industry was clothing and capital is 400k.</p>

<p>I shall name the business partners as A,B,C,D</p>

<pre><code>A is inputting 160k, and being a sleeping partner. (from London)
B is inputting 160K, and at UAE.
C is inputting 40K
D is inputting 40K
</code></pre>

<p>A has no roles and responsibilities.
B will do the purchasing once in 3 months or once in 6 months or as the stock finishes.
C and D will be conducting the daily operation and sales.</p>

<pre><code>The shares that was allocated considering the money and effort was,
A - 20%
B - 40%
C - 20%
D - 20%
</code></pre>

<p>And it came in the following manner</p>

<pre><code>Capital Share from 400K - A 40%, B 40%, C 10%, D 10% 

Effort Share - A - 0%, B - 40%, C 30%, D%30

so Capital + Effort share  = 40%, 80%, 40%, 40% out of 200

so out of 100 = 20,40,20,20. %
</code></pre>

<p>so the 2 problems that raised are,</p>

<p>1/ B is only doing purchasing once in 3 months or 6 months or as soon as stocks finish. C and D says Operation and Sales task are daily on going work and time consuming, so how can someone working in once in 3 months or 6 months have a greater effort share than Daily on going time consuming tasks. so they are demanding for more than purchasing or to reduce the purchasing share.</p>

<p>so isn't it fare to go for a percentage of </p>

<pre><code>Capital Share from 400K - A 40%, B 40%, C 10%, D 10% 

Effort Share - A - 0%, B - 20%, C 40%, D% 40

so final profit/loss share will be 20%, 30%, 25%, 25% ?
</code></pre>

<p>2/ having two separate shares for Ownership &amp; Profit. 2 partners are saying to merge it and keep only Ownership share, the other 2 are saying only capital is counted for Ownership share so there should be both Ownership share and Profit/Loss Share</p>

<p>Please advice.</p>

I started building out a 'rough' business plan for the product because its hard to do a plan on something like a game. I recently started looking at ways for investment to get the project up off the ground. I know this phase is a long way off but i feel its better to know what will be needed later on and try have it ready before I start. Every where I have looked they state that a good solid team is better than having a great idea. My question is if I have a team where I have known the individuals for years, worked with them before and I know there will be a good team dynamic between us all because we know each other a long time and get on(yet still not necessarily friends) is that better than having say a team that has a senior dev and not a strong dynamic?</p>

"8214","Getting Funding For Your Project","<p>I have a business idea that I believe will do really well.  Instead of pitching the idea, I want to pitch the business side of it.  This is what I think investors want to see. Let me know if I'm the right track.</p>

<ul>
<li>They want to see that I have customers already for my product (even if the product does not exist).  For example, getting an AUTH on the credit cards of people interested in the idea ready to pay if I get the X amount of funding to finance said project.</li>
<li>I have a proven strategy to get new customers for said product/service.  The amount of money I spend on the advertising strategy + maintaining product/service is low enough that I take a significant profit margin.  Lets say 30%+.  This includes a financial projection based on these stats.</li>
<li>The idea can scale and grow over time without my own time or effort through proper management techniques.  For example, like how a franchise can expand through the concept of master franchisee's which train your other franchisee's in return for a percentage.  This saves my time to focus on the business instead of the business day to day tasks.</li>
<li>They want to see that I have put my own time and money into the idea to show commitment.</li>
</ul>

<p>If I'm missing anything please let me know.  If I were investing anyways I would want to see these factors... even more than the idea (whatever it may be).</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: The advantage to traditional funding would be the expertise that could be provided by the investor and since my particular business idea is more targeted at business to business I'm not sure it would work in a crowd funded scenario, not sure what I could offer the average person. I have to think it out further. Traditional investors could also offer the capital I need then in this case to expand further, through advertising, hiring staff etc.</p>

<li>hire someone to do it</li>
<li>use online service</li>

<li><p>Facebook, Wordpress and more...</p></li>

<p>Let's say that I build a working prototype myself at home and don't tell anyone. What now? Can I go ahead and register a business name, then start selling it online (create a product website, sell on eBay, Amazon)? What if I don't register the idea under any patent? Will someone come up 1 or 2 months later with the same product/idea and sue me? (Somehow I believe this is not the way to go, but you could clarify why).</p>

<p>Let's say that I want to go into more of a formal startup route. How can I get 'business' people on board and where can I find them? How can I guarantee they will not sell my idea to someone else? Is it possible for a person like me that is not connected at all to go into this route? I'm an avid reader, what literature do you recommend me?</p>

"8308","Partners are not putting the effort - what to do?","<p>I'm a founder of a startup with another 7 (!!) co-founders. I was the visionary and the main founder. Along the way I believed in giving percents to people I thought would contribute. A rookie mistake as it turned out.</p>

<p>Sadly, after about 3 years I see I'm alone. More specifically, almost no one does anything, except one other co-founder.</p>

<p>There was very little done by others in the beginning, but mostly nothing even then.</p>

<p>So, now I've got only 25% for myself, doing about 90% of the work. I don't think there is any financial reason for me to continue - as the others are benefiting by doing nothing and myself benefiting little even in face of success.</p>

<p>The company was bootstrapped 100%, so no investors to deal with here... Also, the company is just starting to get paying customers, but not in any really meaningful way.</p>

<p>I would be glad to get advice on what to do now. Should I just leave? If so, how? Renegotiate terms?</p>

<p>If I'd like to open a similar business but without those partners - could they sue me? What could happen?</p>

After 2 years the company is undergoing an acquisition. Half the stock of <code>X</code> i.e. <code>E/2</code> is still unvested.

"8336","Selling local restaurant ads in app - pricing and trust","<p>I have an idea for a local app. It is a guide to a specific (week-long, annual) conference with thousands of attendees. There's a big need for the app and if I give it away I'm pretty sure it will be heavily used. I'm also sure the attendees will be pretty hungry twice a day (lunch and dinner). So I'd like to put local restaurant recommendations in there, and sell the slots. It seems like a good deal, a restaurant pays a fixed amount and gets a guaranteed full house.</p>

<p>As a complete business beginner, how do I approach the restaurants?</p>

<ul>
<li><p>How do I determine the price for a placement? I could take into account the number of additional guests I bring to a restaurant, their margins on the dishes, etc.. Or I could just pull a number out of my nose.</p>

<p>From my side, since I don't have fixed costs, and this is still a hobby project, this doesn't easily suggest a certain minimum price.</p></li>
<li><p>What kind of guarantees can/should I give the restaurants? As a restaurant owner, I would want to know that a) a certain amount of people use the app, and b) these people all see the add. I don't feel I can <em>prove</em> either to them, they just have to take my word. I could make payment conditional on success, but then I'd have to run after every single payment, and prove that they had as many guests as promised.</p>

<p>If I was a big company with good reputation, this point wouldn't be such a problem.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>By the way, I know there is also demand from the restaurant's side - at previous such events, restaurants printed leaflets and made special offers for the conference guests. So I'm pretty sure the model is viable. It can be a side business but also scale (other events, cities). I've looked into the technical and legal aspects (e.g. business registration) and they should be OK. But the business-to-business ""hustle"" part still gives me trouble. Any advice on how to proceed and make a solid plan out of this?</p>

I registered the business as my sole one, before one week and still didn't disclose this to him.. For now I didn't incorporated the project because we still don't know if this will be successful and funds are not sufficient. He is not prompting to talk about the business registration too.

<p>Up until now I've been directing all my links to the paid version of the app, but I'm thinking maybe it would be better to direct people to the free trial version? Are there any studies or anything on this kind of thing? </p>

<p>The free version is a one week trial that will stop working after one week and prompt the user to buy the full version. Here are some quick stats for january:</p>

<p><strong>Paid version</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Visitors on Google Play: 1033 </li>
<li>Installs on Google Play: 49 (4.7%)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Trial version</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Visitors on Google Play: 2540</li>
<li>Installs on Google Play: 778 (31%)</li>
</ul>

<p>People who visited the paid version from the link in the free version: 126 (17% of 778)</p>

<p>Of those 126 people, 21 (17%) installed the app</p>

<p>Let's crunch some numbers! Let's say my links on FB and my website drive 200 people to my app each month. If they go to the paid version, roughly 9 of them will buy the app. If they go to the free version, roughly 60 will install the app, 10 of whom will visit the paid app, and at last about 2 of those will install the app. Based on those numbers I should keep directing traffic to the paid version. </p>

<p>However, there could be all kinds of unknowns in those numbers. For instance, the people who are willing to click on a link to Google Play might be more willing to convert from the free to the paid version after they've tried it, but they might not want to buy the paid version directly. Any thoughts on different strategies?</p>

<p>Back in April, I was offered a payrise and a letter of Intent stating that with the creation of the new company and product along with it, I shall be receiving  a CTO role and a 5% equity of the company.</p>

<p>The issue with the letter of Intent is that the Company name specified is no longer the company that was created, they have since rebranded before the company was actually formed.</p>

<p>The new company has just been created and now the directors have told me that the roles will come about around investment time (April this year).</p>

<p>And as a bonus, I wouldn't be paying any tax on the equity sue to entering an ESI? I don't really know what that means, but from what I understand, I only get the 5% so long as I work at the company. (How would that affect me when they come to sell? Could they just fire me and reclaim my share?)</p>

<p>I am in a very good position in that a lot of work needs to be done before they can get investors involved, and, its very likely that without me, they wouldn't get it done.</p>

<p>My directors have the 'gift of the gab' and as such, I'm almost always won over by what they're saying.</p>

<p>So my questions: 
Is the letter of Intent worth anything? 
What questions should I be asking about all of this? 
Should I leave? I know that I can earn a much better wage elsewhere.</p>

<p>I realise that this is totally unprofessional but it looks as though I have lost the Letter of Intent in my recent house move, should I ask for another and be honest or just ask for a letter of Intent in the new companies name?</p>

I just formed my first LLC online by filling in a few names and addresses and forking over $100. Maybe I missed some fine print, but does this financial exchange / agreement implicitly mean I am the initial owner (assuming I didn't do the ""paper""work under contract for someone else)?</p>

<p>Currently, this company has no operating agreement or EIN. As far as explicit contracts are concerned, as far as I'm aware, there are no members. So suppose some random guy decides that he's the owner of this company then proceeds to draft and sign this agreement. What happens if he submits this to the state? Maybe something prevents this (he might need access to my Web account to amend things), but more importantly: Why does there seem to be no explicit owner when you start a LLC like this? And if it's not a weird gray area, who is legally the default owner and why?</p>

We have now been joined by a former major (local) bank senior vice president (call him B) who has the right connections, so organisation and sales is up and running. Surprisingly, the strategies seem to work, even after I did all sorts risk analysis, MC evaluating and checked for all the possible biases I could find. </p>

<p>We've gone ""live"" in the sense that both A and B have put in capital to test the algorithm from January 1st to May 1st. </p>

<p>The issue is that I live abroad, and thus work at home and travel every alternating week. A is reasonably busy with his day-to-day doings, and so I am mostly left to my own devices when I am at home. B is not committed more at this moment than he is evaluating how the model works, and will decide if he commits fully May 1st or thereabouts. I am the only person in the little company with any math and tech-knowledge, so all coding, testing, implementation, API development, risk analysis etc is up to me. However, all of the major problems have been solved during the last year, and the system is up and running (most likely) as efficiently as possible at this stage.</p>

<p>When I am with A he usually changes his mind about what is important quite often, and we often go quickly from project to project without going sufficiently in depth. He never did anything like we are doing before. Thus we rarely make that much headground when we are together,. Algo-trading is obviously hard, and so I spend a lot of time reading papers and books to stay on top and incubate new ideas. While helpful and interesting, I am not sure if this is the best way to advance the company's chance of success. </p>

<p>Please keep in mind that the company in question will <em>not</em> be looking for customers for my app, i.e. they won't be spending time for my app. They get customer for other projects and they're simply thinking of suggesting my app as something extra just in case they and I can make some extra cash out of it.</p>

"8522","What kind of evolution (curve) does ""new users of a mobile game"" figure follow?","<p>In order to make some estimations of income and sever costs, I'd like to model how many new users per month I might expect from a moderately successful mobile game.</p>

<p>In my spreadsheet, I let the total amount of new users be a variable.</p>

<p>Now, I'm currently using a normal distribution to model the amount of users per month, but a normal distribution is symmetric and it doesn't seem right that market reach grows as fast as it shrinks (I'd expect some slow start, a quick growth period, followed by a slow decrease of installations).</p>

<p>Question: what kind of curve would fit the pattern of new users installing such app?</p>

<p>The business is gumming rollers for all kinds of industries (tobaco, wood, paper etc.) and my job is to find buyers for restoring those rollers, so I travel arroun the country (mainly 3 big cities with the biggest industries) and go to different large and small companies trying to land a deal.</p>

<p>However, I have this ""x service"" and I want to start <strong>a new business</strong> with it.  In gross terms, this ""service"" reduces the costs of the IT industry, so it could generate a lot of money and the customers are well known (and there are a lot of them).</p>

<p>But, my problem is I want to build a business of $100m (if not a unicorn). However, most investors and VC that I have seen are small fries, a relative one obtained 80k in a round (for a different project). For a single person (or a paper company that will go to nowhere), 80k is big money. However, for a real business, 80k is no more than spare change.</p>

<p>So my question is how to deal with more serious investors?. For me, it's the first time dealing with investors and I want to jump to the big leagues (or am I wrong?).</p>

<p>Should I do a meeting with many investors (maybe in a conference room?) or visits each investor?.</p>

<p>Does some sort of organization with investors exist?.</p>

<p>What should I use?. Powerpoint for presentations?.  Should I use a tie and formal dress? or informal? (such like Steve Jobs style).</p>

<p>Should I knock the door of Microsoft directly? (to say a name for example).</p>

<p>IMHO, the first investor will open the doors for other investors, so I hope to give a good deal to the first one. However, I hope seriously for the first deal, i.e. anything lower than $1m is not serious at all. Should I be pushy?.</p>

<p>PS: In reality, I am not highly in need for money, I can run this business with my own resources. However, I want money to accelerate growth.</p>

"8538","Ensuring founder commitment through vested shares?","<p>A partner and I are in the process of establishing a startup.</p>

<p>Our current arrangement is that I will make a financial commitment to the company as a set amount invested over the next two years, in exchange for 50% equity. My role in the company would be more consultative than hands on, but I agreed that I would step in to fill in the gaps re: operational responsibilities as needed/as I am able. I will keep working my current job.</p>

<p>My partner, in turn, would work full-time at the company in exchange for the other 50% of the equity, and would not be putting any money in. They would also be receiving a salary to cover basic living expenses, etc.</p>

<p>Basically, I put in the money, my partner puts in the work.</p>

<p>Now, we have agreed that vesting shares would be the best way to ensure a commitment from both parties. It has been proposed that my shares be vested in proportion to how much of my financial obligation has been met. For example, if I have only paid 50% of what I said I would and decide to back out, I only get 50% of my shares.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, my partner's shares are vested based on time spent at the company, again over 2 years. If he spends 50% of the agreed time and then decides to quit, he only gets 50% of his shares.</p>

<p>My problem is, I am imagining a potential scenario in future where my partner does not want to continue working in the company, but does not want to leave until all his shares are vested. Might he stick around and do the bare minimum of work just to 'run out the clock?' I do not want to be paying into something to which both sides are not committed.</p>

<p>In my case, it is easier; the money stops so the commitment ends. But in my partners case, should there/could there be a bare minimum amount of work set that would establish his continued commitment to the company? How might this be put into writing?</p>

<p>I have voiced these concerns to my partner, and he doesn't seem to think there is a possible solution to this issue, and that there should just be a certain level of trust going forward. I'm trying to be a bit more pragmatic and would like to find out whether there is precedent for this type of situation and what people have done to resolve it.

<p>We currently only sell the software with a yearly licence attached. The product works fine, but we have fallen into a hole where our clients keep on calling us at the end of the month with problems with their time entries, not related to software fault, but related to new employees, or funny time entries thus operational reasons.</p>

<p>This is keeping us so busy during the day, that our employees cannot do much more than just answer queries. We have decided that the best way forward would be to start charging for this support, or sell support contracts. </p>

<p>We need advice on how to ""convert"" old clients to accepting that they need to pay. We cannot just off the bat start denying support. So we need a process to gradually introduce the support cost that the client will need to pay. The clients currently ""expect"" us to give them help for our software. </p>

<p>It is not always hours of support per client, it may take us 5 ot 10 minutes to solve some problems. We have thought of starting to charge ad-hoc for support queries, but because the time per case can be so short, we cannot charge the client only a few bucks for each call, that is a lot of billing admin for not much extra.</p>

<p>Please advise on how we could approach this conundrum? Also we rather ""want"" clients to pay monthly for a support contract, but we realise that we cannot force that upon them, so how can we convince them to rather take a contract than ad-hoc services?</p>

<p>Example Ideas:
Should we load the ad-hoc pricing? </p>

<p>Should we make the process of getting ad-hoc support very cumbersome? How? (For instance in large companies, they normally have policy against accepting invoices without first requesting a purchase order from finance, so just having to do that, makes a company decide to rather take a contract than having to go through the process every time they need help working).</p>

<p>Thank you in advance!</p>

<p><strong>EDIT/UPDATE:</strong> </p>

<p>From the answers below and some more discussions we reviewed our first attempt at an SLA agreement, and realised it was more just a ""Service Agreement"". We did not have any information for response and turnaround time. We only mentioned additional services (like weekly verification of data accuracy) and that the client will pay ad-hoc when rendered by us.</p>

<p><em>License Agreement:</em>
We have realised that we should rewrite our <strong>licence agreement</strong>. Thus the ""benefits"" included when clients pay the <strong>yearly licence fee</strong>. It should clearly stipulate what is included (like free updates and basic support which we will express in a basic SLA agreement with for instance 24 hours response time). Also the reasoning behind why we charge yearly license fees, is that the client pay a fee to have right to use our software.</p>

<p><em>Support Agreement:</em>
Then we will convince the client to commit to a ""<strong>Support Contract</strong>"" which will consist of an SLA with faster response and turnaround times. Reasoning behind why they would pay for a <strong>Support Contract</strong> is because this binds us to provide support to them. Our software comes with a large hardware investment, and they wouldn't want us to just decide to close shop leaving them in the dark. They pay monthly so that we can acquire the necessary resources. Also the SLA provides a guaranteed service level which they can expect to receive, and should give them re-assurance. As our product are heavily used during month end payroll.</p>

<p>We will also look at ""tiered"" fees for the ""<strong>Support Contracts</strong>"". The cost will be fixed per month, calculated using @Baronz's answer below as guide. </p>

<p>For our smaller clients the <strong>Support Contract</strong> will include a fixed amount of support time the client can use under the contract terms and cost. Any out of contract support will be charged ad-hoc at a higher fee per hour than the included time in the contract. We also decided we will allow 1 month roll-over, so that a client can use more support time in the next month if he did not use all in the current month.</p>

<p>For our larger clients, we will provide a ""unlimited"" time support contract, calculated based on the total amount of employees in the company. This ""Support Contract"" would be a bit more expensive (we will consider how much support time a client can use of such size), but we may also provide a SLA with ""priority support"". </p>

<p>With our product we will include a small compulsory support contract for the first 6 months, then the contract will be month-to-month, and he can cancel with 30 days notice. The client can also upgrade his support contract if he continually need and pay for out of contract support.</p>

<p>We will also continue to have ""Service Contracts/Agreements"" for any recurring monthly activities that the client may ask for, like backup service.</p>

I need to build the product's prototype with which I will seek investors to invest in the new company that will be founded for this purpose.</p>

<p>I am a software programmer but needed an electrical/electronic engineer who would help to build this product. I have two options:</p>

<ol>
<li>Employ an engineer to build and then pay him off.</li>
<li>Partner with an engineer to build the product and the engineer owns shares in the company.</li>
</ol>

<p>Option 1 could be easily achieve but, even if the engineer have Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) signed, how am I sure the engineer who now knows the idea doesn't go somewhere far to implement my own idea? Because of this, I decided to go with option 2.</p>

<p>I was able to get engineers interested in hearing what the idea was all about and I also explained to them the two options and why I wanted to stick to option 2. They showed interest but they were too earger to know how it would work. At that point, I simply told them we needed to sign partnership agreement before disclosure.</p>

<p>My worry is that these engineers that I have contacted all gave one or two excuses why they do not want to go ahead with the project after reading the Partnership Agreement, even after being told that the agreement can be negotiated so as to make both parties happy.</p>

<p>I am confused. Am I doing something wrong? They all seemed excited and interested when they were first told. Then they were eager to know how it would work, then give reasons for not being involved after going through the agreement. </p>

<p>I paid a professional lawyer with years of experience to draft the agreement. I even tell them that we could both negotiate the terms so that all parties are happy. What am I doing wrong? Should I go with option 1? What are the risk in any of the options? How can I find a good partner?</p>

"8679","In a Limited Liability Company, how does a shareholder's equity get affected when subsequent changes to the company's shares occur?","<p>I think an answer to the following simplified question should help me. If you would like to help me with my more specific scenario, then you can read the detailed question at the end. Thanks.</p>

<p>--</p>

<p>Simplified version:</p>

<p>If Person-A is the sole owner of a limited liability private company. Then one day he gets an investor, Person-B, and sells him 20% of the company for his investment. Then, later, Person-A agrees to sell a further 10% of the company to another investor, Person-C...</p>

<p>Do both Person-A and Person-B proportionally share a loss of their shares when Person-C gets their shares, or are Person-B's shares fixed and secured to him, and therefore only Person-A bears the affects of the transfer to Person-C?</p>

<p>I hope that is clear and succinct enough. Thank you.</p>

<p>--</p>

<p>My specific scenario question is:</p>

<p>I have recently begun a new startup. It is basically just me and a friend as partners. But we both acknowledge that I should be entitled to a larger portion of the company, so we have agreed to an 80-20 split. His 20% is broken up as: 5% for being a co-founder; another 5% as reward for his ongoing role as an advisor; and 10% which he has bought.</p>

<p>The company is officially only in my name alone. When it comes time to give my partner his share of the profits, the accountant will officially incorporate him then to give him his share. (This is for a tax benefit to all, which we both agreed to.)</p>

<p>We are trying to understand though... If we sell a share of the company to an investor, then do I solely bear the 'loss' of shares, or do we share it proportionally. And if proportionally, then does the friend 'suffer his loss' from all his 20% or just 5%, 10%, or 15%?</p>

If I've paid them under $20K through PayPal, do I need to be sending them any tax documents? I've been conflicting information on this.</p>

<p>On the one hand, my accountant told me that I do need to file a 1099-MISC to anyone I've paid over $600 ($600 is the minimum requirement for a 1099-MISC). However, someone else told me that since I've been paying my contractors through PayPal (not via cash or check), there's actually a different and relatively new 1099-K form (which AFAICT is for credit card payments, or payments through third party transactors) that this would be subject to, where the minimum is $20K or 200 transactions. (More info here: <a href=""http://smallbiztrends.com/2015/01/1099-contractors-paypal-credit-card.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://smallbiztrends.com/2015/01/1099-contractors-paypal-credit-card.html</a>)</p>

<p>When I asked my accountant about the 1099-K and if this was true, he basically shrugged and said nope, this wasn't true, but the way he answered wasn't very confident and I'm not sure to trust how up to date he is on the new 1099-K form.</p>

Let's say, after 2 months, one person wants to buy some of our shares. How do we create new shares? Can we create and sell unlimited number of shares?</li>

<li>Let's say we allocated 1000 shares of $1 value each. Now what? Do we have to pay dividends to shareholders? Or can we give them more shares instead of dividends?</li>
<li>Can a shareholder say ""I don't want these shares anymore. Give my money back."" !!? And if yes, what do we have to do? Do have to pay him/her the value of his/her shares in cash? And if yes, what happens to those shares? Do we have to delete them?</li>
<li>Let's imagine we are working on 2 different projects at the company. Can we split the type of their shares? Can we say this share A belongs to the profits of project A, and share B to project B? Or do we have to found another company for project B to do so!?</li>

At this time, the company has a US corporation and no foreign entity in Germany or elsewhere. Even though we don't have a subsidiary here, I was able to get a 4-year work/residence permit in Germany as a sort of representative of my company sent from the US to explore the market. So it's worth noting that I am paid in USD by the US corp. </p>

<p>My employer makes a B2B software product used by mobile app developers, and my primary role is to develop the German and European market. That includes hosting and attending industry events, forming strategic partnerships, and speaking to potential clients. </p>

<p>It's time for us to build a small team in Berlin, and we're deciding whether in the near-term we'd like to: </p>

<p>a) set up a GmbH for the sake of hiring 2-3 employees </p>

<p><em>or</em> </p>

<p>b) continue operating in Berlin with the US corp only and hire Berlin-based freelance employees (who have the right to work in Germany and would also be paid by the US corp in USD, same as I am) </p>

<p>I've spoken with a number of German lawyers and accountants, and I haven't been able to get a clear answer on whether b) is something that's allowed or if it'd potentially cause a problem with local authorities. </p>

<p>I have learned that it's a hiring company's legal burden to ensure that a freelance employee is <em>truly</em> a freelance employee, that is, has at least one additional client while working for us; otherwise, our company might be liable to pay a social insurance tax during the time the freelancer worked with us. </p>

<p>But as long as the employees we hire fulfill that 'true freelancer' requirement, are there potential legal or tax issues with hiring freelancers from our US corporation to work in Germany?</p>

<p>• I don't want to be held personally liable for any actions the company takes that are in violation of German law or tax policy</p>

<p>• We expect we'll need to set up a GmbH in the mid-to-long-term and wouldn't want the parent US corp to be in bad standing when we start that process</p>

We are at the very beginning of the development. We are trying to develop a prototype to demonstrate everything in order to atract investors and eventually get funded.

A couple of batchmates had been working on it for some time and they wanted a lead developer. I was offered the position of CTO and cofounder and was mentioned as a cofounder everywhere. I was given 8% esops to be vested over 3 years. The 8% was so that I would have a significant stake in the company and feel it belongs to me.</p>

<p>I was told by the guys that they can't give me direct stakes yet because of some tax issues and something I am not entirely clear of. So they told me they'd give me esops which would vest over 3 years and convertible to stocks.</p>

<p>I had only agreed to join if I got the 8% because that way I could feel I was working on MY product.</p>

<p>I joined only a while back so none of the esops have vested yet. So another company is looking to merge with us now. I was just informed by the other two members that 'The merge happens on the current holdings only' which basically means that I won't get any stakes after the merge happens because none of my esops had vested yet. None at all. Zero. Maybe a better salary and some good position. But then without stakes, I don't feel like this would be my company at all.</p>

"8746","Selling equity out of a subsidiary not yet formed (x-post from law)","<h1>Background</h1>

<p>We're setting up a self-organizing, horizontal and open company where ownership is (de facto) defined by dynamic shares (DS), which are created when a worker contributes towards the company. The legal implementation of this involves a company (C later on) that forms contributors agreements with the workers and acts as a portfolio buying the DS off the users. </p>

<h1>Involved parties</h1>

<p>A: An investor, individual, both wealthy enough to be concidered an accredited investor and falling in ""friends or family"" category, so probably no blocking regulations.</p>

<p>C: Company that de facto acts as a holding company buying the ""dynamic shares"" off the workers. De jure this is implemented by an elaborate contractual framework, where the contributing users are essentially contract workers. The contractual framework is somewhat complex, but we have that mostly figured out and it is not the topic of this question. The company has not yet been set up, but will be located in Ireland.</p>

<p>K: Placeholder limited liability company located in Finland. Has ended up doing things not directly related to C as well.</p>

<p>J: Main developer that needs money immediately to buy food etc.</p>

<h1>What is happening de facto</h1>

<p>A pays J money on a monthly basis for exchange of the dynamic shares he has created during that interval.</p>

<h1>Planned legal relations</h1>

<p>1) J&lt;->K</p>

<p>J works for K as a freelancer. J gets paid. K gets the DS created by J during that time.</p>

<p>2) K&lt;->C</p>

<p>Shareholders agreement etc documentation is set up so that C gets the DS owned by K and in exchange K gets a monetary equivalent of C's shares.</p>

<p>3) A&lt;->C</p>

<p>A buys the shares of C from K. The interval between A giving K money (eventually enabling J to buy food) is estimated to be between 6 and 24 months.</p>

<h1>Actual questions</h1>

<p>1) seems pretty trivial and just the matter of handling things right in the contributors agreement.</p>

<p>2) seems again something that could be a bit tricky, but something that should be completely arrangeable based on my limited legal understanding.</p>

<p>What I'm wondering is what is the correct way to handle 3)? This shouldn't be that different from a run-of-the-mill company forming a subsidiary and selling equity out of it before it has been incorporated.</p>

So we approached our boss and he said that we could test our idea with the patients of the 2nd floor. This means develop software, buy special laptops, and test. So everything's good since we can cover the costs for this 2nd-floor trial.</p>

<p>The 2nd-floor setup costs us $30,000. Best-case scenario, 2nd floor trial is a success and now they want us to install it in the 3rd floor. We somehow manage to install our software/laptops at the 3rd floor, but it's getting hard. Then another hospital calls us to install it in a whole wing. We don't have the budget for that. And here's the issue.</p>

<p>The concern of one group member is that, given our limited budget, we won't be able to expand as we would like to. At the same time, GE Healthcare hears about the software and decides to develop something similar. They have the resources to deploy in the whole state. Once they do, we will be irrelevant.</p>

<p>What do you guys suggest? If it were up to me, I'd say we go for it. But he has a valid point.</p>

<p>He also mentioned going directly to the large company (ie. GE) and explain to them the idea, since they have all the infrastructure. I told him that was a bad idea.</p>

"8821","Dividing equity between founders in a IT startup","<p>So basically we have a very complicated situation so I apologize in advance for the long post.</p>

<p>I'm gonna use (fictional) names in the post because it's gonna be a lot easier to understand the story than if I'd use names like person 1, person 2, etc.</p>

<p>Let me just say that this is an IT startup and that the product of it is a web application which is supposed to greatly simplify the workflow and improve the profits of the companies who do business in our target's industry.</p>

<p>At the very beginning Barry approached John with the idea of making this platform because John has some connections and experience in the target's industry. John told Barry that the idea he presented to him already exists so he refined it so that we have a unique product. They both don't know anything about programming so John found Tim and me (we are computer science students) through a mutual friend. So we set a meeting and unfortunately at the end only Barry and I were able to be there. Tim told me to speak on his behalf and I assumed that Barry also had the same permission from John to speak on his behalf. Barry told us their idea and because he is a (business management) student himself and he/they can't pay for our work, we reached an agreement that we would be ""equal partners"" in this project. By that we thought that Tim and me would have 50%, the same as them. And the fact that we haven't discussed the specifics of how the equity would be divided turned out to be a major error. Anyway, we agreed that we'd work on the product and that we'd regularly update them on our progress and that when we'd have the most important features implemented that we would call for a meeting where we'd present the application. The deal/plan was that Barry would pitch the product to an investor he knows and that John would bring the first users from the project's target industry on the site because he has connections in it. </p>

<p>Approximately a few weeks later they brought Alison on board without asking us prior to it what was our opinion on the matter. They said that they don't know the law very well and that she works in a big oil company in the HR division and that she could help us with her experience in marketing and financial matters. After three months of programming (just to make clear, that wasn't three months of full time programming, we had college obligations after all so it was like a day or two of two-three hours programming on it and then the third day we'd spend 7-10 hours on it) we finally implemented what was asked of us (the backend was almost done, but the front-end needed to be worked on some more before we could actually launch the product) so we (as we'd had agreed to before) called for the meeting. Unfortunately Barry couldn't be there because he is studying abroad and he wasn't in the country at the moment. </p>

<p>So we showed our product to John and Alison (they didn't say how they liked it explicitly, but John said that we should just make some tiny changes so I guess he/they were pleased with the product). And then came the bombshell. Alison told us that they had already separated from Barry and they are moving forward with the project without him and that they don't know if Barry is gonna go forward alone with the project. She also revealed to us that Barry conned her out of her equity (she didn't give us the specifics), that she wasn't even aware that we even existed ""until just a short time ago"" and that she has no knowledge of any deal that we had already made with Barry. How was she able to split the equity with Barry and John in the first place without asking who's gonna make the entire product for them and how are those people gonna be compensated is beyond me (it's obvious that she is lying). That's basically the summary of that meeting. We then talked with Barry and he (of course) said that everything they said was not true and that he isn't guilty of anything.</p>

<p>After that we were basically left with a few choices, two of them being - 1. renegotiate and resume working on the project with Barry, or 2. do the same with Alison and John. We contacted both of them to assess who is lying and who is serious about this project. The negotiations with Barry aren't relevant for this question so I won't write about them. Anyway, we contacted John and Alison and told them that if they want our code, our full time commitment to the project in the future (because someone is gonna have to implement new features and maintain and worry about the servers and the code and oversee the whole eventual IT department when the firm is gonna be founded) that we (Tim and me) want 50% of the equity (because that was our original deal and we wouldn't have even considered entering the project in the first place if they offered any less than that to be honest because they couldn't pay us in any other way and we knew that we'd have to spend an enormous amount of time to code something as big as that). They just replied that our code isn't worth for them to give us equity. To be clear, their sentence implied that the code wasn't worth not only for 50% of the equity, but that it isn't worth for any equity at all. It was clear from their response that they thought they'd give us something like 5% equity or completely pay us some measly amount for the code. If they had the kind of money that is needed to pay for such a big project in the first place I think that they would have said so in the first meeting and that then Barry wouldn't have had offered us equal equity (and if they had that kind of money they also could have hired a professional firm, not us). We think that they thought we are idiots and we also think that to ask 50% in this case is more than realistic. </p>

<p>I mean, John polished that idea with Barry so it even isn't 100% his idea and he has some (unconfirmed) connections in the target's industry, but if his idea/our product is as good as he thinks it is then those connections are irrelevant because they would come on our site regardless. Alison on the other hand came later into the project and she is supposed to make the business plan (which we haven't seen and we are very suspicious if it even exists on paper) and everything along with it (marketing, financials...), pitch the project to potential investors, etc. So from our point of view asking 50% is very realistic. I don't know how they divided their equity in their ""new"" project, and if we joined them I don't care how they would divide their 50%, I'd say that 35% for Alison and 15% for John (or even 40-10) sounds fair. I'd like your opinions now, are we asking too much or are we being played for fools like we think that we are and how many percentage of the equity do you think Alison and John deserve. And I'm really sorry for making such a long post, but it was needed in order to accurately tell the story (because this is like some bad soap opera lol).</p>

<p>The site would only post jobs, let people apply, notify of openings, let employers review candidates, and perhaps add the ability for employers to send W2s, that would be it.</p>

"8862","Equity split meeting, incorporation","<p>This is a question about equity split and incorporation, but it is not about splitting between co-founders. My (part-time) co-founder and I have agreed that I will take more of the company until it grows and then when he leaves his job equity will transfer to his side. There is no problem with this, everything seems fair and everyone is happy. Sweet Right?!</p>

<p>Here is where things get tricky. I have been involved in creating a startup incubator (not off the ground yet) with a mentor of mine. This mentor has been very helpful and supportive over the last year and has provided connections and knowledge to help us reach our short term milestones. I really think he would be a person worth keeping on board.</p>

<p>However, he and another acquaintance of ours (a finance guy) were approached by a couple of people who really needed business help (engineers with great tech but no business/personal skills) and so they created a venture group to help these guys get their thing off the ground. Now they want to do the same thing with us and they are asking for something in the way of 20% equity. For background, we are a mobile app company in beta stages.</p>

<p>It is my thought that 20% is way too high, and we are not in need of a CFO at this stage with no sales. However, I do want to keep the mentor on board for a more reasonable equity split. I am thinking it is too high because of multiple reasons...</p>

<ol>
<li>It will make our cap-table too complex and dissuade investors from coming on board.</li>
<li>It is too much to give up of the company at this early stage.</li>
<li>Even the mentorship that comes from places like Y-Combinator cost nowhere close to costing 20% equity.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Questions:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>What are your thoughts on the equity for the mentor?</li>
<li>Any suggestions about how to handle this in the upcoming meeting about equity split? I know this meeting will be uncomfortable (and I am perfectly fine with that) but I want to make sure I handle this right and hopefully am able to keep the mentor on board for a fair price.</li>
</ul>

<p>PS. I am aware that mentors normally shouldn't be asking for equity, and this makes me uncomfortable for sure, but I think the value he adds may be worth the hassle.</p>

<p>PPS. I am also a member of a prominent startup accelerator, and this is what is pushing us toward incorporating right now.</p>

<p>I have started a business of an IT company that provides services such as Designing, Development and Digital Marketing. We also have some products lined up for release which are our ideas purely and will be  made into applications.</p>

<p><strong>The Company</strong></p>

<p>The name of the company was decided by me. The company is not yet incorporated. I started working for this company 5 years back but now I plan to take it seriously and further which I couldn’t in the past because of my Master’s Degree.</p>

<p><strong>The Office</strong></p>

<p>The Office is running at my home itself. It is my room with all the setup. I have borrowed a screen, a printer from my friends for free. I bring in all the office supplies including snacks, toffees, lunch as well (my mom makes it for us even though she is working).</p>

<p><strong>The Furniture</strong></p>

<p>I brought in all the office furniture from my sister's house. I got it all for free, which should have costed me around 40K if I were to purchase it from the market. Later I bought a chair worth INR 3400.</p>

<p><strong>People</strong></p>

<p>2 of my friends and me are working right now. One of them is the CTO (Technology), the other one is CTA (Tech Architect). All 3 of us left our jobs to work on our own. So, I feel they need to have some ownership in the company but not as much as me. All 3 of us work on our own laptops with an additional monitors attached to them. I am the CEO and handle everything including Design, sometimes backend, Frontend, Keeping in touch with the Client over email and phone, Decisions, Project Discussions, Vision of a project etc. The CTO and CTA have not invested any money or pay for any expenses except sometimes when we eat snacks or dimsums.</p>

<p><strong>Q1.</strong> How much of the company should they own just for leaving their jobs, working day and night on backend and sometimes project discussions?</p>

<p><strong>The Expenses</strong></p>

<p>All the setup and recurring expenses of the company like Internet, Hosting, Domains, Business Cards, Electricity and everything else are being paid by my parents. I use a credit card to make these payments or they give me cash. Additional accessories like Printer cartridges, mouse, keyboards etc. and all eatables like snacks, disposable things etc. are all the things I buy (from my parents money). So, in a way all the seed money is coming from my parents.</p>

<p><strong>Q2.</strong> Should my parents own some part of the company because they are paying for everything and have spent like 30K in 2 months?</p>

<p><strong>Incorporation</strong>
I plan to get the company incorporated within this week. I want it to be Pvt. Ltd. with 2 directors being my elder brother (NRI) and sister. I can ask for help from them for money, marketing or advice any time.</p>

<p><strong>Q3.</strong> Is Pvt. Ltd. the best way to go for this? </p>

<p><strong>Q4.</strong> How much of the company should they own as directors?</p>

<p><strong>More Questions</strong></p>

<p>Q5. I want to have the Products as a separate entity or a subsidiary under the main company so if anyone invests in the Product, they will not be investing in the parent company. Is this a good approach?</p>

<p>Q6. How much should I own as the CEO of the company?</p>

<p>Q7. How much is the absolute amount I should keep aside for the company for growth and expenses?</p>

<p>Q8. Once the money starts coming, how should I pay for the electricity, internet expenses as right now my parents are paying for it? Should I pay from my profit share or from the money kept aside for the company?</p>

<p>Q9. How do I give back the money my Parents have spent in the initial months (Jan-March)?</p>

<p>Q10. Do I absolutely need to appoint a CA for filing taxes or managing accounts?</p>

<p>Q11. Can we have the same people in a Parent company and its multiple subsidiaries with different amounts of ownership? Ex: Me having 40% in parent company but 30% in a subsidiary of this parent company.</p>

<p>Q12. If a subsidiary makes money, should any amount of it go to the parent company? If yes, how is that decided?</p>

<p>Q13. Can the dilution in case of investments be prior decided for every member? For ex: Member A will be diluted 50%, and remaining 5 members will be diluted 10% from their total share, making a total of 100%? Is this possible?</p>

<p>Q14. Should I pay a fixed salary to the CTO and CTA incase no money is earned by the company? Should I sign an agreement with them? If yes, which one?</p>

<p>Q15. If I pay for something ex: Internet totally used for the company from my personal account, can I withdraw money from the Company account right away or at the end of the fiscal year?</p>

"8894","How to find a cofounder without the university network?","<p>I wonder how people can find a co-founder to launch a startup. I mainly think about the tech startups in the Valley, but as far as I know, there are far more successful companies founded by multiple founders than by single. </p>

<p>And I suspect that those companies were started by founders who met each other at the university, if not start it while at the university.</p>

<p>While I don't have any statistics in handy, let me presume for the time being that it is more likely to be successful if the company is co-founded, and those co-founders are more likely to meet each other via college network than not, both of which I guess are true.</p>

<p>This view is likely in coincidence with some people recommending co-founding in the Valley, like Peter Thiel and Paul Graham. But while they explain the reasons, they don't talk much about how people can find a co-founder without college network, as far as I investigate. Well, <a href=""http://www.paulgraham.com/startupfaq.html"" rel=""nofollow"">Paul claim</a> that it is the best to find him or her in college, and then at work, but he didn't talk about other options. </p>

<p>For your information I dropped out of a college, and I don't have any friends at all. I'm not American and have never lived in USA. </p>

<p>So to recap my question, here is the primary point of what I want to ask:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>If you don't have a college network (and prior working network), how can you find a co-founder?</p></li>
<li><p>If you have to find a co-founder outside of the above two, is it better to look for someone by job or skill, or by the same goal and then make him or her (or myself) transform their own role to meet the needs among the team (e.g. if I am a software dev and the potential co-founder is also a software dev, either the one transforms to a designer or marketer or hardware dev or whatever that should work for the team)?</p></li>
</ul>

<p>I don't just want to find a co-founder; I want to find a co-founder in a way that is going to lead to success. That's why I don't like a meetup, which I don't find leading to success.</p>

And we will probably correct it, i.e. we will surely choose the best and most profitable idea among these, and focus on it.</p>

<h2><strong><em>The Problem:</em></strong></h2>

<p>When we found the company, we were 4 founders, so we decided on 25% for everyone. Through years, many things happened:</p>

<ul>
<li>One of the founders had to leave the company (because of personal problems.)</li>
<li>Some founders had to work part-time, while some worked full-time (again, because of personal problems).</li>
<li>The amount of money invested in the company by the founders are a little bit different.</li>
<li>The number of ideas brought by the founders, and the value of each idea, are different.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Now this is the question:</em></p>

<p>We want to re-determine the % of each person. How shall we do it? Which parameters have higher impact? Founders' personal investments? Or founders' time and man-hours spent on projects? Or founders' brought ideas? And if it is a combination of all these factors, which parameters have highest weights?</p>

<li>Production and Assembly</li>
<li>Shopping (Providing elements, materials, tools, ...)</li>
<li>Administrations (Official Letters, Contracts, ...)</li>

<li>Management</li>
</ul>

<p>These activities are all done by the 3 founders up to now. The shopping person, for example, might be the CEO as well! The man-hours spent on each category, and each work is recorded. Also, the regular daily hours spent by each founder is like this:</p>

<ul>
<li>Founder.A : 10 hours/day</li>
<li>Founder.B :  6 hours/day</li>
<li>Founder.C :  4 hours/day</li>
</ul>

<p><strong><em>Now, here are the questions:</em></strong></p>

<ol>
<li>How should we split the shares/equity? 33% for each? Or based on man-hours?</li>
<li>If based on man-hours, shall we apply weighting factors for different categories? For example, 1 for Design, 1.5 for Management, 2 for Personal Investment, 0.5 for Shopping, etc. !? If so, is it fair? (Considering the fact that all 3 founders could do each job, i.e. the shopping person could do the management too. Or the IT person could do the Design. We just split the works among us to ensure that all the works are done on time.)</li>
<li>Shall we allocate shares for these activities? Or salaries?</li>
<li>If the answer to Q3 is salaries, then, How shall we split the shares/equity? What factors are important else than daily spent time, man-hours, and personal investment?</li>
<li>One of the founders is the idea person. He had the idea, and he worked on it for 1-2 weeks to evaluate and initial test. Then he brought it to us. The other steps are done together. Including the design and production of initial prototype, secondary prototype, and the final customer product, along with other categories mentioned above (sales, shopping, IT, ...). Now the question is: How should this idea person be treated? Shall we allocate extra percentage/shares/equity to his idea (specially because he worked 1-2 weeks on initial tests)?

All money that we earn this month, we use to create a budget for the next month, and so on (PS. for us it's not yet possible to create annual budget and reserve money for it). </p>

<p>Our income consists of:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>work we do ourselves</p></li>
<li><p>work that we outsource</p></li>
<li><p>work that we do via freelancing websites</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The first two points easily fit into our monthly budget as we get that money usually within 5 days we send an invoice. </p>

<p>However, money that comes via freelancing sites (oDesk, Elance,...) is a special story. Namely, if I submit the bill this week, money will land on our bank account is approx 20 days. So I am not sure how to treat this money - April earnings or May earning and how to calculate it into our May budget.</p>

<p>So it happens for example, than in April we earned $1000, but until end of April only $500 came to the bank account as other $500 comes from the freelancing sites and it will land on the bank account on 10 May.</p>

<p>So far, we calculated budget only from money we have on the back account. Not from money that will land in 10, 20, etc. days. This way I am sure we're not dealing with ghost money, but rather with real money. </p>

How much is reasonable?

- £10 per PC/Laptop Per week 
- £20 per server per week. 
£50 P/H for out-of-contract works.</p>

Could this structure work?</p>

"8989","How to calculate the monthly salary?","<p>We are a startup company of 6 people, with 1+ year activity. Now we want to set up a salary system.</p>

<p>Normally, salaries are paid based on job title, experience, location, etc. So the salary is almost a fixed amount. E.g. they agree to pay $4000/month to an electrical engineer of 3 years experience. </p>

<p>Actually, there are complains about this fixed salary. We have proposed 2 methods to solve this problem, and pay the salary according to efficiency:</p>

<ul>
<li>Calculate the salary based on <strong>effective hours</strong> worked in a month.</li>
<li>Calculate the salary based on <strong>works done</strong> in a month.</li>
</ul>

<p>However, there are many problems with both of these methods:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong><em>How to count the total hours?</em></strong> Some people do the marketing and sales, so they're not usually at the office. Some work at home or online. How shall we count the hours worked?</li>
<li><strong><em>Impact of IQ in time</em></strong>. Some people complete a specific work at e.g. 8 hours, while smarter people do the same work in 2 hours. So it would not be fair to just count the hours.</li>
<li><strong><em>How to quantify the works done?</em></strong> Say, a person completes a lot of daily tasks in a month. How to count them? And how to convert them into dollars?</li>
</ol>

<p>Is there any other method of calculating the salary which is fair and efficient?</p>

<p>I look forward to your suggestions. Your time and help are really appreciated.</p>

<p><strong><em>Edit 1</em></strong></p>

<p>The working hours of 6 of us are different. Some work 40 hours/week, some work 20 h/w, some 30 h/w, etc. And it varies week by week!</p>

<p><strong><em>Edit 2</em></strong></p>

<p>In our company, almost everyone has 2 different roles. For example, I work as ""IT Admin"" and ""CEO"". My friend works as ""R&amp;D Manager"" and ""Secretary"". And surely the hourly wage for CEO and IT Admin are different. So we want to find a way to count the hours of each work and role, so that we can calculate the monthly salaries fair and correct.</p>

Note that there have never been any signed agreement between Will and Jack and that the story takes place in the United Kingdom.</p>

<p>Jack spent a ten weeks full time on the project, iterating several prototypes, calling potential clients, etc. while Will was part time (less than 20 hours a week). The not-yet-incorporated company got selected for a for-fee accelerator program (£720) six weeks after Jack started being full time. Jack paid 40% price of the four-month long program, as he was guarantee 40% of equity. In addition, Jack lived far away from said program, and incurred an additional cost of about £130 per week to travel there.</p>

<p>A month into the program, Will and Jack split. Will continues the program and the company. Jack retreats to his initial location and no longer attends nor participates in any activity of the program. Will also asserts that Jack no longer owns any equity in the company. However, until the end of the program, Jack continues to pay the small monthly fee for the Google Apps (about £10/month).</p>

<p>Is Will legally bound to reimburse Jack the price he paid for the accelerator program and for the incurring expenses? Or, on the contrary, can Will simply state all the expenses incurred by Jack were just poor investment on his part, and the total of £328 company expenses plus £720 of travel should be considered pure loss?

While I don't know much about Postmates (I don't live in US) but as far as I know they seem to just build up the platform or infrastructure and let third-party local restaurants deliver their foods to consumers, through Postmates' mobile app.</p>

<p>However, I wonder that for these kind of startups, how they inform their service and entice the local restaurants owners to call to their network. In other words, how can they contact them and then win over them to join their service. </p>

<p>Certainly, it would take too much of time and effort to just approach each owner one by one, and if they do in such an inefficient way, it is easy enough for other entrepreneurs to set up the same service in each city, or a big company just starts its own platform and conquer all the market.</p>

<p>So my question is:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>For these kind of startups, how do they inform their service and entice those owners?</p></li>
<li><p>Is their method appropriate or is there a better way potentially?</p></li>

<p>There seems to be a quite common occurance that prices of some products are adjusted almost daily, often by <em>less</em> than a $ USD/£ GBP. I would assume that these small changes are due to adjustments to foreign currencies.</p>

<p>I have also noticed that when a unit of a product is sold, this sometimes seems to affect the price, by larger percentage changes. I have seen both price drops and price increases in the price after I have made an online purchase of that very product. This may be due to supply/demand considerations.</p>

<p>This has made me wonder if online retailing platforms today utilize 'automated' (or ""robotic"") price-setting algorithms. These retailers stock a large amount of products, so I'm having a hard time believing the price-setting is completely manual.</p>

<p>There is also the possibility that price changes are made in reflection to the prices that competitors are putting to market, but that may or may not be automated.</p>

<p>It wouldn't surprise me if major players like Amazon use such things, in fact I'm assuming they do. But do e-commerce platforms for mid-to-small-range online retailing enterprises utilize such tools? If so, what are some examples of e-commerce platforms that offer such features?</p>

However I was told point blank by the people who run the incubator that the investor will get a flat 7%. What is correct? How much will the investor get if our company is valued at 1,000,000? 10,000,000? $500,000? The safe note says the following. <strike>Sorry I cant post the whole thing.</strike> The draft version attached below.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>$20,000 (the “Purchase Amount”)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(a) Equity Financing. If there is an Equity Financing before the
  expiration or termination of this instrument,
  the Company will automatically issue to the Investor either: (1) a
  number of shares of Standard Preferred Stock equal to 
  the Purchase Amount divided by the price per share of the Standard
  Preferred Stock, if the pre-money valuation is less

  Preferred Stock equal to the Purchase Amount divided 
  by the Safe Price, if the pre-money valuation is greater than the
  Dilution Cap.</p>

<p>Definitions:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Safe Price” means the price per share equal to the Dilution Cap divided by the Company Capitalization.</p>
  
  <p>“Company Capitalization” means the sum, as of immediately prior to the
  Equity Financing, of: (1) all shares of Capital Stock (on an
  as-converted basis) issued and outstanding, assuming exercise or
  conversion of all outstanding vested and unvested options, warrants
  and other convertible securities, but excluding (A) this instrument,
  (B) all other Safes, and (C) convertible promissory notes; and (2) all

"9029","Is it a good idea to have lots of tradesmen in a company?","<p>I've noticed that when it comes to tradesmen (plumbers, carpenters, electricians, etc.) most tend to operate as sole traders rather than in most other fields where professionals might build a big company and get brand recognition.  I'm wondering whether there's a good reason for this.  I personally don't see one.</p>

<p>So if I'm a skilled tradesman, is it a good idea to try and build up a larger company with many tradesmen or are there benefits to remaining a sole trader?  It seems to me that remaining a sole trader, like in other industries, means that I don't have the economy of scale that a larger business would have, nor the same resources for advertising, and so being a sole trader might be disadvantageous.  Why, then, are tradesmen almost exclusively sole traders or at least very small outfits?</p>

"9032","What should I do with my concept?","<p>Some time ago I finished a concept of human-computer interaction based on 10/gui from 2009. When I saw it in 2010, I couldn’t get it out of my head and started working on my own concept, taking into account imperfections that 10/gui definitely had.</p>

<p>My concept takes imperfections arising from using mouse, touch screen and 10/gui into account, lets user free of any wearables, rapid changes in habits and information overload. At this point, I won’t unveil much information, though anybody could say “I’ve seen something like that somewhere”, but the strength of my concept lies in many details and the whole thing seems quite finished on essential basis. I mean, there is always something to add or describe in more detail, but there is no point to do it at this stage.</p>

<p>Right now, I have 40-slide “short” presentation and 150-slide earlier presentation. I had to remade whole presentation from scratch to be able to show it to someone who doesn’t have enough enthusiasm to study something like this for hours. It took a year extra. </p>

<p>During the making of these materials, some prototypes of similar kind appeared in media, such as Leap Motion, Ractiv Touch+, Apple Force Touch, Sensel Morph, and some others. They all have one thing in common: incompleteness. Solving one thing while adding others, improving A while overlooking B. But the message is clear: there is a certain need for advanced human-computer interaction concept (among those outlined in 10/gui) therefore there is a gap on the market.
My problem? Not sure what should I do with that. I tried to consult it with people in business incubators, but the concept, even it’s described quite well, is still just weightless idea. I've literally run away from contest for business ideas. It just didn't fit between other ideas (like 'We are developing an app called Fnargelblarg developed in Knurkelplurg++ and we need $$$'), moreover mine was too technical for those businessmen and it just couldn't be described in 5 minute limit. Plus I can’t build it from scratch as I have no skills and don't know bunch of geek enthusiast to do so. All the people I've shown the concept gave me positive feedback, but I don't know anybody who would say something like 'I get it, it has great potential and I want to do it"".</p>

<p>I tried to contact one startup and university, but without an answer. I would try more, but I’d rather ask you what would you do in my position. I just want to make this happen and to have some control when implementing the idea. I know what should it be, what the target market should be, which features to add in future and how the end-user devices and advertisement should look like.</p>

<p>Is patenting a good idea? The concept would be protected and accessible to public on database, so it might interest some relevant people. What do you think?</p>

We have all shareholders having the same equity. Is it a standard thing to have something in the shareholders agreement that will cause a shareholder to lose his equity if they no are longer interested to work on the project?</p>

<p>In order to build the product and start the business, all shareholders are required to invest their time and do a significant amount of work. We have no investors, i.e. shareholders that would get their equity by putting money or something else then their own time and work into the project.</p>

<p>Now, here is an example of undesirable situation. Say we work together for couple of years and then, for whatever reason, one of us won't be able to continue. Others will still have to work hard to keep the business running and growing. </p>

<p>Does it make sense that the one who stops working (not temporarily, like for couple of weeks, but permanently) on the project loses his equity at some point (after some time, or over the time, or alike); or does it make sense that this shareholder will continue to keep his equity (forever)?</p>

<p>We have two opinions in the team. One is that the shareholders should never lose the equity regardless of how much they contribute. The other is that without such a motivation, if someone stops contributing, the whole project inevitably dies or has to be sold because all others will lose their motivation (why would you want to work to earn money for someone else who has the same equity as you and does nothing anymore...).</p>

<p>I am very interested in technological startups, and I am considering the idea of work for a startup to see something different.</p>

<p>I noticed that most of the job offers proposed by startups are not for Java developers. I know that nowadays the best front end technology are related to JavaScript (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AngularJS"">AngularJS</a> and <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/React_%28JavaScript_library%29"">React</a>). But it is not difficult to integrate a Java back end to an AngularJS front end (for example; it is absolutely good practice to implement a back end using the Spring Framework and then use its MVC component to create robust <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer#RESTful_web_services"">RESTful</a> web services that serves the AngularJS front end).</p>

<p>The thing that seems me so strange is that, for startups, the most popular position is for <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PHP"">PHP</a> developers. What does PHP offer that Java doesn't? I think nothing. Indeed, it tends to be much less robust than Java as it is not natively strongly typed. But I don't want to open a flame war between Java developers and PHP developers.</p>

<p>From my experience, I think that the Spring framework provides a real state-of-the-art software architecture, and I really don't understand why it is considered the main reference in the enterprise development, but is not considered in startup projects.</p>

<p>I also noticed that <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby_on_Rails"">Ruby on Rails</a> is becoming very popular in startup projects. Does this language offer something that Java doesn't?</p>

One of the partners is the main party who deals with all the technical side of the business and has all the other passwords and server details.</p>

<p>One partner has fallen out with the others and removed them as admins. Then after some 'kissing and making up' they are all friends again and everyone is admin, but now there is a need to make some changes and this childish option of removing the admins may occur again. It is not possible to rule out.</p>

<p>Is it better to try to maintain the status quo, everyone happy and trust that it wont happen again, or to be 'once bitten twice shy' and take the opportunity to remove that person as admin so they cannot do it again.</p>

<p>A significant following has built up on the facebook page and it leads to some business. This other partner has in the heat of the moment threatened to take the page for themselves and run things by themselves. </p>

<p>This company is based in a former soviet union country where it is difficult to enforce things and copyright laws are lax. </p>

<p>This process is part of an going process to pivot the company offering. It is in an early stage and the partners don't agree on their visions for the future of the company. Due to communication barriers / culture clash it is not possible to discuss the difference in visual. The main source of customers is from the technical side- website / facebook etc. Therefore the strategy is mainly focussed around altering the website. </p>

<p>The main thing is not to create an atmosphere of conflict but to smoothly transition to a new position ""development of new ideas"".

<p>I've been living off online poker for the past 5 years. I decided to quit poker and pursue something more fulfilling. So, last year I enrolled in a web design (community college) program with the plan to transfer to university after 1 year and study CS. Now I'm unsure if I want to be spending the next 4 years of my life in university, because by the time I graduate I'll be 32yo. Although, without a CS degree I'll have less leverage over my employers, and my options are going to be limited if I later decide to work outside of web design.
So here are my options:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Build a portfolio and try to get an internship in front end, JS, or UX design.</p></li>
<li><p>Complete 1 more year of community college, then intern.</p></li>
<li><p>Start 4 year CS degree studies. I'm approved for grant money that would cover 2/3 of the costs.</p></li>
<li><p>Continue learning on my own and build things. I have money saved up that I can live off of for 2 years.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Note: I have NO work experience, as I've been living off online poker for a long time. I'm interested in so many things (front end, back end, UX/UI), but the end goal would be to start my own thing or work remotely once I gain experience in the field. I've wanted to study CS for a long time now, because many areas of it interest me, but 4 years is a long time for someone who's starting at 28 years old.</p>

This was more of accumulating knowledge, not for a customer and without any revenues so far. Now I have a prospect company (system provider) working in my target business sector I want to work in and they are interested in my know how from that project. Additionally, I currently think about changing company for my permanent job. The prospect company would also be perfect for me to work with them on a fixed contract (what they offered to me) which would also have positive aspects for me like</p>

<ul>
<li>getting more responsibility for the entire inhouse project, not only supplying legwork</li>
<li>getting more into my target sector in terms of contacts and better customer understanding</li>
<li>don't care so much about social insurance costs as when working 100% freelance</li>
</ul>

<p>While working with them, I still want to retain my own company and do some work on my other occasional projects, lets say a few hours per week.</p>

<p>I am aware that this strategy might cause troubles, because I want to work with similar customers with the prospect company as well as on my own company.</p>

<p>I thought about the following possibilities to handle this issue</p>

<ul>
<li>work part time for them and keep the rest for own projects. Issue here is still a similar customer base (except I won't handle big customers on my own company)</li>
<li>working inhouse as a usual employee but on a freelance contract, ensuring this will cover my costs</li>
<li>developing the project on my company's responsibility, getting paid by supplying their special use case</li>
</ul>

<p>I am not really sure how to handle this. Key is to me, to get into the target sector in the medium term and to retain the options I have with my own company but avoiding the unsteadiness of an early startup.</p>

Since a few years, I see more and more enterprise advertisement talking about how they can do great things for ""<em>your brand</em>"" instead. Even when the targeted customers are companies that do not really have a brand as their main asset.</p>

<p>For instance, one of our competitors is (like us) selling internal enterprise software, and their clients are companies. But their advertisements say:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[We] provide [software] to some of the most recognizable brands, including T-Mobile, Konami, the U.S. Army [...]"".</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The sold product has nothing to do with branding or marketing, it is just boring internal calculation software.</p>

<p>I have seen several such examples. Maybe I am just unlucky and stumbled upon a few examples of erroneously-worded advertising that I should ignore?</p>

<p>If not, what are the benefits of saying ""<em>brand</em>"" instead of just ""<em>companies</em>"" or ""<em>organizations</em>"" when advertising something that has nothing to do with branding?</p>

  <p>The ability to select among revenue streams has broadened and
  complicated a decision previously restricted to pricing. First, for
  many firms, the choice between revenue models involves trade-offs that
  arise because increasing revenue from one source (e.g. subscription)
  most often reduces revenue from an alternative source (e.g.
  advertising or the sale of user information)</p>

<p>In this, there is a piece of text which reads:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In the context of email marketing, computing incremental sales via a
  simple comparison of outcomes across those receiving and not receiving
  the email with an offer (in order to measure the effect of the email) is rendered
  inappropriate due to the selection inherent in targeting.</p>
  
  <p>Well-designed experiments can, in theory, overcome this problem. In
  practice, however, these experiments need to be executed with care
  because they can be non-representative, costly, and time-consuming.</p>

<p>So, what does <strong>selection inherent in targeting</strong> mean? And why does it make the computations of incremental sales difficult/inappropriate?</p>

<ul>
<li>has an on-paper brilliant and original idea</li>
<li>gets some venture capital to implement it</li>
<li>sets up a website, and</li>
<li>runs some big ads in big media.</li>
</ul>

<p>But the website gets little traffic, because its conceptualisation and design are so appallingly bad. The founders don't know how to implement their idea, they can't even write good copy, and their site comes across as if it's a turnkey mom-and-pop store trying to look like a global bank, with a couple of texts thrown in that look like a cross between Christmas <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Round-robin_letter"" rel=""nofollow"">round-robin letters</a> and a high-school student's attempt at journalism. Their investor can't help much either, being used to funding some flops in with the occasional gem, a known operational hazard in dotcom investing.</p>

<p>Some of the founders prepare to move on. Others know the idea is brilliant :) but what they're waiting for is...someone who</p>

<ul>
<li>moseys in as a user</li>
<li>""gets"" the idea and its brilliance, and</li>
<li>is willing to supply some clues and the necessary ingredient of some knowledge of how to kick it into shape and get it off the ground</li>
</ul>

<p>The person they're looking for probably has no great business or startup experience, but he understands the concept and its workability, which few do and which the venture capital investor doesn't. And in about three hours he could show the founders that</p>

<ul>
<li>""you've got to do X""</li>
<li>""you've got to do Y the way they do it at A""</li>
<li>""you've got to know about Z"" so on,</li>
</ul>

<p>The poor founders didn't even know about X, Y, A and Z, but they will get the point right away, and together with the person who has approached them they could shift the startup into the right direction for being a big-time success. Because the idea was always brilliant, right? :)</p>

<p>Obviously they can't advertise for such a person, because essentially they'd be saying they don't know how to implement their idea, which doesn't look good. But they want to be open to an approach from such a person if one exists among their users.</p>

<p>Let's turn it around and look at it from the point of view of the user who knows how to implement the idea properly. The last thing he wants to do is to email the startup and say here's what you've got to do. If they get what he's saying, they'll just do what he says. Thanks, mate. He won't get anything for his troubles. He'll just have helped them multiply their turnover by 100 and start reaping large profits, for free.</p>

<p>Essentially he wants to tell them stuff but on condition that they can only use it if they pay him - both a consultancy fee and in shares, and also in a share option. The problem is that what he tells them isn't necessarily easily showable to be something that they couldn't work out for themselves, even if in practice it's clear at the moment that they're not working it out for themselves.</p>

<p><strong>Background</strong></p>

<p>I am 22 and have been living in France for about three years, I am currently registered as an auto entrepreneur and have a French bank account etc.</p>

<p><strong>About the company</strong></p>

<p>We provide an online language learning platform specifically for people in Europe to learn to speak and write English through online courses with other native English speaking teachers.</p>

<p>The company is 100% online and we simply connect the teachers with the students while charging a percentage of each lesson for administrating the lessons, course-ware and payments.</p>

<p>The teachers come from all over the world.</p>

<p><strong>Questions</strong></p>

<p>Q1 -</p>

<p>We are starting small but expect to exceed the annual revenue limit for Auto-entreprenures (€32,600). Due to our low profit margins we have to move to an EURL registration so that we are taxed on our profits instead of total revenue (which would kill our business).</p>

<p>Has anyone had any experience with the different business structures in France (EURL, SARL etc...)?</p>

<p>I'm specifically interested to know what the hidden costs are and whether I can navigate the registration process my self without paying accounting and legal experts as our business is bootstrapped with very little (read ""no"") expendable capital.</p>

<p>This quote from an article entitled ""The pitfalls of France's auto-entrepreneur status"" got me concerned... it reads:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Although some employers, especially English teaching academies will
  push you to be an auto-entrepreneur, you should be wary, lawyer Jean
  Taquet tells The Local.</p>
  
  <p>“The government knows a lot of language schools employ teachers on an
  auto-entrepreneur basis when really they should be putting them on
  their payroll. These teachers can suddenly get caught in the crossfire
  when authorities decide to audit a school,” Taquet says.</p>
  
  <p>“The government is using auto-entrepreneurs (AEs) as bait to go after
  the companies,” he adds.</p>

  administrative adds: “We have known of a couple of companies who were
  only employing AEs when really they should have had salaried people on
  their books and these businesses have been caught out.”</p>
  
  <p>Under the rules of being an auto-entrepreneur you should have more
  than one client paying you for your services, because if you don’t
  then really you should be on a contract and the auditors will be
  looking out for this.</p>
  
  <p>“If you are constantly working for someone or especially if you sign
  some kind of exclusivity agreement with them, then that will be an
  issue with authorities,” Denison warns.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We make it very clear in our Terms of Service that we are not employing teachers, we are simply providing a platform for the teachers to manage and interact with their students as well as a service to manage their payments.</p>

<p>So my question is how exactly will this work, we are not employers, we are service providers and the last thing we need is to be heavily fined and taxed on our already low profit margins.</p>

<p>Interested in hearing from anyone who has walked a similar path, what were the pitfalls, what should we be looking out for? Any resources or articles would also be very much appreciated.</p>

But the problem is that the staffs' conditions are really different:</p>

<ul>
<li>Some people are working at home. They come to the office once or twice a week, give reports, get to-do lists, and continue to work at home.</li>
<li>Some people are working part-time, some work full-time, and some work extra-full-time !!</li>

<li>Some people work at the office, and some work out of the office. Some work both in and out of office.</li>
</ul>

<p>We've tried the following methods:</p>

<ol>
<li>Staff manually submit the hours when they come to the office or when they exit the office (Enter/Exit Hours). This method had several problems:

<ul>
<li>Some staff work at home, or out of office. So they don't come to the office to submit the enter/exit hours.</li>
<li>When at the office, some staff do their personal works, play games, waste time, etc.! So it cannot be considered worked hours!!</li>
<li>After some time, some staff ignore to submit the daily work hours, because they think it's difficult and time-consuming!</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Staff manually submit the daily hours they work for the company. Instead of submitting the enter/exit hours, they submit the real worked hours. This method solves the problem of work-at-home or work-outdoor staff. But still has these problems:

<ul>
<li>It is difficult to judge the submitted and claimed hours, i.e. some staff work at home from 9 AM to 5 PM, where only 2 hours would belong to the company and the rest were about personal works or surfing the net or playing games! But the employee submits 8 hours for that day instead of 2 hours!!</li>
<li>Some staff ignore to submit the daily hours on that day, and prefer to submit it weekly, where it is just a guess, an estimate, and might be more or less than real worked hours.</li>
<li>Some staff again think it's difficult and time-consuming to submit the daily hours!</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<p>As you see, we've had difficulties recording the activities of staff. The final goal is to be able to calculate the salaries fairly; but to do so, we have to find a proper method to record or monitor the activities of staff.</p>

<p><strong><em>So, How should we record the activities of staff!?</em></strong></p>

<hr>

<p><strong><em>Edit 1</em></strong></p>

<p>It is not essential to record the <em>hours</em>. The main goal is to track the output. But to do so, we probably need a quantitative parameter. What is it? <strong><em>And how should we track the output and results?</em></strong></p>

If all 4 except Zuckerberg wanted to sell, as is the popular belief, then they could have forced a sale in some way - sold critical assets, agreed to a very close partnership with Yahoo, and/or diluted Zuckerberg down over time by issuing and buying stock. These are all completely legal and above board (at least compared to what Zuckerberg et al did). Likewise they could have easily vetoed a sale with their board majority.

<p>There are many methods out there but the one of my friend is very unique and no-one has every done the similar things.</p>

<p>My question is that: </p>

<p><strong>Is he creating a brand new market segment?</strong></p>

<p><strong>A market segment</strong>: A group of consumers that share multiple characteristics, such as demographics, behavioral propensities, psychographic similarities, geographic relationships with unmet or underserved needs, that is large enough, and accessible enough to present a viable marketing opportunity for a business. <a href=""http://www.investorwords.com/19309/market_segment.html#ixzz4AIoY0L4E"" rel=""nofollow"">Source</a></p>

<p>Ok, let see this example, there are many types of pizza such as Cheese Pizza, Mushroom pizza, Tomato Pizza, etc. All these types of pizza are not sweet.</p>

<p>These types of pizza formed their own market segments. </p>

<p>And now suddenly you came up  with a brand new type of pizza - The sweet Pizza (honey, sugar, ..., no meat or cheese or salt). </p>

<p>Suppose that no-one has made the sweet pizza before &amp; suppose you the FIRST one who made sweet pizza. </p>

<p>The question is that:</p>

<p><strong>Are you creating a completely brand-new Pizza market segment?</strong></p>

<p>Also, what should you say in your advertisement?</p>

<p><strong>Should you say that your pizza is the best one (or noone is better than yours) or just say that it is the unique one (very interesting one &amp; do not mention that your one is the best one)?</strong></p>

<p>The reality is that very hard to attract the customers to use his new method. But Steve Jobs said ""<strong>People don't know what they want until you show it to them</strong>"" <a href=""http://www.forbes.com/sites/chunkamui/2011/10/17/five-dangerous-lessons-to-learn-from-steve-jobs/#4dd68f4560da"" rel=""nofollow"">Source</a></p>

<p>But trust me, it's very hard to convince people to use my friend's new method. Other peoples who start their businesses using the same methods as everyone else in the market can easily find new customers.</p>

"9432","Is overtime management required for an IPO?","<p>Here is a scenario that I am living for the third time in that many years:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A startup is doing well (or claims to do so), and wants to go for IPO. This desire implies many changes in behaviours, practices, etc. One that often shows up is the management of overtime work. Employees suddenly have to badge in/out of work, and <em>formally</em> apply for overtime.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Is that really necessary? This question surely depends on the legal system, so the answer should focus on the US, but bonus points for other countries.</p>

<hr>

<p>This question stems from the irony behind such a requirement. A startup that succeeds in an IPO is very likely to have its employees work <em>more</em>. Why spending time on filing in forms and book-keeping everyone's work, when most would surely use time in a more productive way.</p>

We are allowed to contact potential customers and develop products during this time, to start head first into market after founding a company near the end of that year of funding.</p>

<p>Currently we want to find potential customers to cooperate with them as pilot partners during the initial implementation. One venue for this is to visit industry conferences in our field of business.</p>

<p>Our problem is that we don't know which job title to put on our business cards as there is no company yet. We are definitely working for example as software developers but our income is paid as a ""scholarship"" from the grant so there is no job title connected with that: officially we only have to develop the business plan.</p>

<p>We thought about several different titles but there were always some caveats:</p>

<ul>
<li>C...O: too ""big"" for a (not yet founded) 3 people company</li>
<li>Lead Developer: on its own this title might make people think they are not talking to decision makers</li>
<li>(Co-)Founder: there is nothing founded yet so this might be misleading</li>
<li>(Co-)Owner: sounds like we are/were not part of the founding process</li>

"9483","What to do about intellectual protection from the get go?","<p>This is a lot of different questions so I hope someone is patient :( and in a helpful mood.  Aside from kicking around a couple idea's that I've actually spoken to some investors about I developed more questions than answers and I didn't want to post these questions to them and reveal my lack of understanding.  </p>

<p>You've been working on some software, or online service you want to make live.  What should you have done IP wise before hand?  Let me ask this way, I'm almost done reading the book about the creation of Twitter (There inspiring to me, finished Elon Musk's biography last week was a great read) What did they do, if anything to help ensure another group of people didn't just duplicate the exact same thing when they only had 50 users for example?  Or could they have even done anything?  I'm guessing they could only protect there name but the act of the microblog post was not protect able?  Did places like Twitter and Facebook just get lucky that they got big quick and became the norm so fast that duplicating it would just be a waste?  And as a nobody service with no profit are your registering your new service as a business?  Did Twitter Incorporate in the beginning?  Did they Partnership?  Or do nothing? </p>

<p>And secondly, I'm used to the simple creating of startups like Bob decides he wants to sell Bob's Coffee.  He registers his business as Bob's Company Inc.  And protects Bob's Coffee.  It seems today however that there isn't really a company name that then sells a product name.  The product and company are the same.  So using my Twitter example above, the name of the service was Twitter, and that then is also the name of your company.  Do you register Twitter as a business, trademark and copyright the name?  Is the service itself now patent?</p>

<p>Sometimes I find it hard to look at certain things as a business.  For instance when Google just started, it was just a little search engine.  It often amazes me that they got all these investors and that it became what it is.  If I saw a little search engine I'd think most people would say ""Oh, ok thats a nice website""  Who would want to give a website that just looks things up for you money?  How is THAT a ""business""?  So its hard for me to know what idea's are businesses and what ideas needs registered and how.   </p>

<p>If some of you had to do it all over again and you created an online service today, say people could sign up and post pictures (Instagram), you and you online worked on it at night after your 9-5 and it functioned and was ready to be used by other's.  And that's it, no registering of any kind for anything has taken place.  What is your next list of things to do?</p>

<p>This is a lot of questions and ranting I know, I'm all over the place.  I always am but I've had these questions building for the past 4 months and I've had no one to ask.  I just accidentally saw that StackExchange had a startup's section.</p>

"9497","What percentage of my business should I give to an angel?","<p>This is my first post here and I'm not well versed in venture and angel investments, so sorry if my question is too <em>naive</em> or stupid.</p>

<p>Anyways, my situation is as follows: I own a company that has developed and patented a system with the potential of earning 10 figures in a 10 years lapse. Please note that <strong>this potential has been properly measured by all parts involved</strong> and is based on prototype testing and publicly available info (its application would be by the government of my country), so there's no questions about this: <strong>we all agree on this potential, even the investor.</strong></p>

<p>Now, when we went to money talks, the <em>angel</em> offered 100k (US dollars) and he would bring a friend to add another 100k. For that , he requires 33% for each of them. Also, he would add something very important for us: <em>contacts (so it's a hands-on angel)</em>. However, <strong>that would mean to give up the company right from the start</strong>. Also, that kind of money isn't a big issue for me, I could simply sell one of my homes (but of course, if I can avoid the risk, then better).</p>

<p>The only REAL thing that matters that he might add and <strong>I know I need</strong> is <em>contacts</em>. And because of the nature of this system, this addition is of <strong>utmost importance</strong>. However, if even with these contacts the projects doesn't work, then I'd be at bar 0, only that having giving my company.</p>

<p>One thing to note: <strong>as big as the potential of this project is, without government authorization it's worth 0</strong> (then again, it can be split in cities or provinces, so if it fails at national level, we could go smaller, or even try other countries, thus that <em>zero worth</em> is relative)</p>

<p>I'm already declining his friend's involvement. But even then, 33% for 100k on a project that even the investor agreed is a gold mine looks extremely off base. Even considering his <em>contacts</em> contribution. </p>

<p>I took a read to <a href=""https://money.stackexchange.com/questions/26337/what-to-ask-for-on-a-business-partnership""><strong>this post</strong></a> which makes a lot of sense, but it doesn't consider that I'm adding everything while the other part adds a minimum amount of capital (and yes, the contacts). And I profoundly disagree that ideas are worth nothing, but just in case, we don't only have ideas, but also patents and around 60% of the project already done. IN general, I'm more inclined to the <a href=""https://startups.stackexchange.com/questions/6215/what-should-i-offer-to-someone-who-wants-to-invest-into-my-business""><strong>advise provided here</strong></a> in the answer by Trenton Tyler</p>

<h1>So my question is:</h1>

<p><strong>is this kind of percentage for that kind of money realistic? What kind of percentage should I agree on? Or should I arrange that same percentage only with a bigger amount of money?</strong> (Again, money is not an issue for me, so I'm not very prone to this)</p>

<h1>Addendum</h1>

<p>Of course I'll go for advise by professionals, but which kind of professional would be more suited for this? An MBA or a lawyer? <em>(Obviously, I'll add a lawyer to the mix, but I mean for the financial advise)</em> Or both? Or should look for different professional opinions?</p>

<h1>EDIT:</h1>

<p>I want to thank everybody who answered because you helped me decide a path of action. One of the reasons why I need these contacts is because </p>

<ol>
<li>I've very limited ""people skills"" (low Asperger Syndrome) so I usually need to communicate remotely or by proxy unless I know the person before hand</li>
<li>Dealing with the government in my country means a very high chance of dealing with corruption, something I want to avoid</li>
</ol>

<p>However, based on the answers provided, I already spoke with my lawyer, a financial consultant and a friend who <em>creates and sells</em> startups. They all told me this is crazy, and they offered me to find the investors and contacts for fair shares. They also suggested that, being my project one with really high localization (meaning it can be done in many different cities under different political administrations) I can create micro companies for each local business and then offer stocks to anyone bringing the contacts, which seems very logical to me .</p>

<p>Again, thank you to everybody, I'll choose an answer as correct as per the site's requirements, but they all helped me and I wish I could choose all of them</p>

"9508","Did anyone start as doing too much work and feeling like you never finish anything?","<p>I have started my own venture approx 10 months ago. In the past 10 months I have hired 2 junior developers who are progressing well, finishing projects instead of me... but it all took its toll: I am tired, overburden with work, feel lost and after working full week feel like I not finishing anything. </p>

<p>Being a senior developer in the office, it means that I have to advise juniors, help them, but also work over the weekend to fix the problem they could not solve themselves. Besides doing this roll, I also manage the company, do finances, do errands, find clients and negotiate work, do project management, do interviews to find good senior (have not found him yet), research technology to improve the business, research what is the best office equipment for our office,... and yet have to be a family man with a bunch of children and wife. </p>

<p>I know that the main issue comes from the fact that I am unable to find good senior to join our office. I know that he would cover a great amount of work. However, seniors are simply not so ready to join new companies when they have steady job. Also I still cannot afford to offer them 50% more money to come to my office. </p>

<p>I thought about hiring project manager or maybe office assistant, but I would still have to instruct and monitor them. Being a startup means that my connections with my clients are still being inspected by the clients and I cannot risk any mistake that could lead to losing any client. </p>

<p>So at the end of a week, I see dozen of new tasks for the next week and I feel like I have not finished anything in the past week. Also any new man I plan to hire brings new costs to the company.</p>

<p>So right now, I am waiting for my juniors to become more experienced and start earning more money to the company (by finishing more projects faster), but the company is eating me slowly. </p>

<p>Did others feel the same? Am I doing some mistakes I am not aware of? Anyone can see how I can release a bit of my burden before my juniors become seniors and without bringing my company to red?</p>

<p>PS. we have much and more than enough work, but juniors cannot complete queued projects as quickly as a senior could. also having too much jobs in the company, I am unable to spend quality time finding larger clients but have to handle dozen small clients.</p>

"9520","Low budget way to market / validate a product idea during prelaunch as a solo entrepreneur?","<p>I've recently been looking into validating a business idea and read the book ""Start Small, Stay Small"", which gives a lot of tips on what to do to build a successful software company as a one man team. Part of it is to validate that there's a market by building an email list prior to launching / building. The goal is to find out whether or not the conversion rate of the mailing list sign up form is substantial enough to execute the idea.</p>

<p>I'd love some insight from people who have done this before, with perhaps a loose formula for steps they always take prior to actually building the product. 
Since this would be a one / two person venture, assume that the budget is ~$500 (with no investor funding). </p>

<p>To be more concrete, let's say I want to open a website for tents.
Where would I go from here to get traffic to test the conversion rate?</p>

<p>An example of some things to do would be:</p>

<ul>
<li>use a service like unbounce.com or kickofflabs.com for a splash page with an email form. ~$50 a month</li>
<li>open a facebook page</li>
<li>open a twitter page</li>
<li>dump $200 of my $500 budget into Google Ads</li>
</ul>

<p>Or maybe put $75 into a press release service that will publish news of my product into well known channels?</p>

The app is a basic front end (this has already designed &amp; I have produced a clickable prototype in InVision), with most of the heavy lifting done server side. I have a 30+ page spec with all user journeys mapped out, specified how the backend should work, what SDKs I need integrated, what access levels each user type should have etc. etc. But can’t find an agency to build it.</p>

<p>The product is currently undergoing patent review so I cannot be too specific, however here is the gist of its functionality:</p>

<ol>
<li>User scans government ID and populates our register form via an open OCR SDK and their iPhone's camera</li>
<li>User fills in any missing details (email, mobile number)</li>
<li>User scans credit card using card.io open SDK</li>
<li>Our server runs background check API against a third party DB to confirm eligibility 

<ol start=""5"">
<li>User can now be automatically registered to any of our partner sites as a pre-vetted lead with a single tap</li>
</ol></li>
<li>User can access deals offered by the partners he has signed up for via an in-app inbox</li>
<li>User can be logged into the partner sites by the app, or via any other device</li>
</ol>

<p>The challenge is point 5 as none of our partners have an API we can use, therefore our server needs to fill in the partner's registration firm with the users details. We are considering using a Selenium webdriver running server-side, with a script that populates a user's details into a test script and runs on the partners registration form, however I am open to suggestions from the agency that would undertake the project; so far though I have no takers.</p>

<p>Is it just that there is enough business in building pretty brochure apps that there is no need to undertake a challenging project or should I be looking at a totally different type of dev agency rather than an app agency? </p>

Support is free for the first year and from 2nd year on, the annual support/maintenance contract is priced as 20% of license cost.  </p>

<p>So let's say a company buys a 1000 user license at 5000$. Then from 2nd year on they pay 20% of 5000$ = 1000$ as AMC.  </p>

<p>Now in the middle of a particular year (say 6 months into the year) - customer buys 500 additional licenses - how do you handle it? They get support free for 500 licenses for 1 year. So charging 20% of 7500$ for next years renewal is not the correct thing. Ideally, you should charge 20% of 5000$ + 10% of 2500$ for next renewal. And 20% of 7500$ from the year after that.  </p>

<p>My operational costs are very small thanks to inexpensive cloud services so I wouldn't mind paying significant referral fees to anyone who refers a paying customer to me.  For example, I was thinking of paying the referrer 50% of all payments I get from a referred customer for their first year.</p>

<p>My prices are low so referral payments would be relatively small.  A very large customer might pay $1000 per year.  Most customers pay much less.</p>

<p>You see a lot of referral programs, but most of them give credits (e.g., Dropbox increasing your storage amount) rather than actual money.  Are there any drawbacks to paying money to referrers?</p>

<p>We currently don't have any staff. I run the technical side and my partner runs the business side. </p>

<p>I am ready to move onto another project. The business hasn't grown for at least the last 1-2 years, and I don't feel confident that we can grow it further. I would like to find a buyer for the business, but my partner enjoys her work, and believes she can grow the business further. </p>

<p>We don't have any partnership agreement covering what happens in this situation, so even though I would prefer to sell, if my partner doesn't want to sell, then I don't think I can force her. </p>

<p>One possibility is to hire a new CTO to replace me. My question is about what a ""standard"" and reasonable agreement would look like in this case, given that my partner will continue to work full-time. For example:</p>

<p>1) Would it be normal for our equity stakes to remain 50/50?</p>

<p>2) Would I have an input on the salary my business partner gets paid (given that I will no longer get a salary). </p>

<p>3) Would I have an input on the dividend that my partner and I both take from the company? </p>

<p>Currently we run a YouTube channel and website making videos about ""psychology"".  This generates add revenue, and leads from people wanting to be our client in a private session.  These are done with clients over Skype from everywhere in the world.</p>

<p>The site and channel are now so popular that we're essentially turning people away, and our prices are already so high that we're starting to feel uncomfortable with how much we're charging.  Any higher, and they'd set un-meetable expectations.</p>

<p>We'd like to try and steer some of these leads towards psychologists that we've at least vetted and trust.</p>

<p>My question is how to structure the relationship between us and the third party psychologists.  A situation where they pay us a fee for everyone they convert is an option, but then that a leaves a very real possibility that they just lie, and say they didn't convert anyone.  It also means that we only get a one off fee.</p>

<p>We could build a VOIP/teleconferencing platform, and host all interactions between psychologist and client, so that we can monitor them, checking that they don't take their business off site.  That's a pretty involved solution, not to mention that people might not like to have their private session monitored.</p>

<p>We keep the client as our client, and have us collect the money, and then just pay the psychologists, but this is pretty legally involved meaning that we're an employer of sorts, and have to worry about taking payments from the general public etc, not to mention that it doesn't solve the problem of people making their own arrangements to avoid our fees.</p>

<p><strong>From Marc Andreessen's blog:</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You’ll notice that a lot of what you may need to do is kick the ball
  further down the road — make more progress against your plan before
  you raise venture capital. This obviously raises the issue of how
  you’re supposed to do that before you’ve raised money.</p>

"9695","sustainability of a FOREX buy/sell signal service","<p>Sirs,</p>

<p>As a thought exercise, I am wondering about the sustainability of creating an online buy/sell signal service for the foreign currency exchange.  Suppose I (think) I have the ability to predict the rises and fall of foreign currency exchange rates with, say, 60% accuracy.  Further suppose that I realize that I don't have enough capital to make much money on this myself (10% interest per year on $1000 in principal isn't much profit), but wish to sell the trading advice to subscribers to my website for say, $10 per month.</p>

<p>In reality, there are real businesses out there that claim to do this for subscribers.  My question is whether or not this is really a sustainable business model.  </p>

<p>To me this business model is unsustainable -- your product is essentially a paid-for web page or email with a few sentences worth of advice about what to invest in this week.  A product like this is so easily duplicated and redistributed that most anyone can subscribe to your website and simply repeat the information to others for cheaper than your original fee.  Soon, all of your customers would migrate to your competitor who sells an identical product for cheaper.  Your competitor, in turn, has the same dilemma.  In a business model like this, no one would really care about brand name -- customers just need the information for their own advantage, and only care about its accuracy or lack thereof. </p>

<p>To me at least, a financial market buy/sell signal service is an unsustainable business model.  Am I right?  Of the real businesses that claim to offer such services, it is unclear to me how they stay in business -- perhaps they are doomed to failure.</p>

<p>We are currently internally discussing and evaluating the option to offer one-off instead of recurring payments for the following reasons:</p>

<ul>
<li>for a younger audience a one-off payment is more appealing (higher conversion rates)</li>
<li>nature of the product is a ""one-off solution to pass the exam""</li>

<li>easier to integrate ""add-ons""</li>

<p>Additionally, we established some performance based compensation. This is tied specifically to bringing in new clients. They get a cut of the first invoice and a smaller cut of the subsequent 11 invoices (the cut of the first invoice alone is likely worth more than an entire year of scheduled compensation).</p>

<p>For the board of advisors, we worked out giving incentives tied to specific milestones, including bringing in new clients, in the form of phantom stock.</p>

<p>The consultants suggested that I also give them phantom stock. I am fine with that, but is it reasonable to keep cash incentives and put the phantom stock on top or is it reasonable to ask them to chose one or the other. I understand we could lower the %s on both (and give both), but <strong>the question is if it is reasonable to start the conversation from the angle of pick one or the other.</strong></p>

<p>UPDATE: framing the situation - it seems that this is being understood as I am just looking for sales people. These consultants are post graduates/PhDs with extensive experience in their fields. The advisors they brought in are all PhDs. They have experience developing companies like mine. Each deal they close is 6 figures, and becomes a 7 figure deal over the lifetime of the client. This is a B2B market.</p>

She is a US citizen, but currently living in the UK. She is registered as a consultant here, while she works at the university. But we are planning to move to Singapore for a year (for a job) and then come back to the US. We want to avoid setting up a company in each country that we live in, but she would like to keep doing consulting as a second job. I think we would prefer to just set up a US company, would this be legal? The details:</p>

<ul>
<li>She is a US citizen</li>
<li>She has family (so an address) in Washington State</li>
<li>She will move to the US in a year or so (most likelly California) but will be employed in the UK and singapore over the coming year</li>
<li>She would like to be able to bill her current client (UK company) from the new US business</li>
</ul>

<p>Could she be paid with divident or so while living abroad? Would that be legal (I am assuming she can't be employed in both Singapore and the US at the same time). </p>

I cannot afford to hire a developer to build the app. So, I'm thinking about building it myself. </p>

<p>I have some front-end programming experience, but my back-end knowledge is very limited. I know enough to build a simple &amp; good looking website, but I've never built an app before. I'm thinking of <em>trying</em> to build the app myself and learning along the way. But, I'm not sure if that's a good idea, because it would be my very first app and I'll likely run into a lot of issues building it.</p>

<p>Should I attempt to build it myself? Or should I wait until I practice and learn more about the app creation process before I take on a fairly big project such as this? I'm a student, so paying a developer $40/hour is out of the question.</p>

So we're 4 people trying to do something of our own. The 3 are friends who look after marketing and I am the new developer addition.

"10891","What is the exact role of UX experts in a startup context?","<p>I had a conversation with a teammate about the methodology used in a context of new product built by big company. </p>

<p>No need to enter in the details, I explained that Lean Startup principles could (should?) really apply for big companies especially in B2C context since meaning of startup is:<br>
""working under conditions of extreme uncertainty"". </p>

<p>I said that even if the company's Business department gets an idea (about a mobile app for instance) and expects from their IT teams to concretise it, in an ideal world following Lean Startup methodology, the Business dept. members themselves should go out, look for and talk to customers in order to get early feedbacks on the idea/product. They master their idea, so they are the most suitable piece to confront it to outside. </p>

<p>Response from my teammate:<br>
""No, it's the role of recruited UX experts to talk to customers and confront the (disruptive?) idea!""</p>

<p>According to me, UX experts deal with the ergonomics of the solution, the usability.<br>
They might need real customers to test and improve their solutions, but they are not expected to confront the idea to customers initially. 
According to me, Business members should be focused on: ""Should I build this product?"".<br>
UX should be focused on: ""How to improve this product?"".</p>

<p>I'm confused so.<br>
Am I wrong about the exact role of UX experts?<br>
Should the Business stay on his chair without meeting real potential customers? </p>

There's this invention I have the concept for that is actually somewhat simple, so I'd rather not go into the details too much at this point.</p>

<p>Here's the challenge I have:<br>
it requires a certain kind of material that can be made in different ways depending on what's needed for the product to function, and in order to have the material made for it, I'd need to pay something up front.<br>
I'd also accordingly have to show the maker of the material that there will be a definite demand for the product before they'll make it.  </p>

<p>What I'm asking is if there's a site, kind of like Go Fund Me or Indiegogo, where in this case, I could basically make the invention except for the material and show and explain how it would work with the model.  If a lot of people would like to have it, they could show that on the website, and then I'd be able to show the manufacturer that there is a demand for the product I'm trying to develop.</p>

"10902","Can I create a complex design by adding and modifying potentially patented elements?","<p>I am designing a sort of surveillance system, and I have a few questions about patents. I will explain my case with another much simpler but similar example:</p>

<p>I have an idea: a smart mirror that takes pictures of you exactly as you see yourself in it, from your eyes- perspective. This mirror must have a touchscreen, a camera, an operative sistem, etc.</p>

<p>Smart mirrors are probably already patented, but they are home automation devices, or they act like smartphones. In order to make my product work, I'd have to add a camera, install my app, modify the operative system, among others. However, I can't do these modifications by myself. Instead, I will have to order them from a provider/factory, to either modify a smart mirror they already have, or to build a product from scratch.</p>

<p>I want to patent my idea or design - that is, a smart mirror capable of taking pictures of you exactly as you see yourself in it.</p>

<ol>
<li>What do I need to patent, to ensure that the providers (or anyone) do not simply make my mirror for themselves and commercialize it?</li>
<li>I'm sure others have patented smart mirrors, but they have not been used for this purpose. In order to use them for this purpose, there must be done some modifications to them. Also, I'll give my product more uses, i.e. I'll colaborate with (public) administration and companies, and this is what makes my idea attractive. How can I (can I?) use another company's products and modify them in order to run my design? Must I acquire the intellectual property rights if I only hire a company to adapt their mirror's specifications to mine?</li>
<li>If I decide to order a provider to build my fully customized mirrors from scratch, could there be conflicts with other patents, although my product's purpose is to take special pictures, instead of being just a home automation device?</li>
<li>Do you know a better strategy (where, how...) to build this kind of device?</li>

Throughout the years I've always been interested in start-ups and have formed a few ideas for companies myself, however, I've always been too apprehensive about putting a plan into action because of the steep learning curve involved. I come from a background in maths and problem solving (Actuarial student) with little knowledge in business, business law etc.</p>

<p>My question is how a undergraduate (specifically an undergraduate not studying business) with limited available funds can set themselves up for success? I realise that some of these skills will be delegated if the business grows, but starting off, what skills would I need? What resources exist out there to learn these skills required to set up and run a functioning business in the early years? (To any successful entrepreneurs out there) What were the things you wish you knew before you started?</p>

<p>In the interest of clarity, my business ideas revolve around software solutions, technology and one general salable product. I have the ability/contacts to make these things possible, I just need the business side skills.</p>

"10915","What are some good resources for figuring out regulatory and legal issues of running my business?","<p><strong>Note:</strong> This question is attracting answers that simply provide sources to research from. As I mentioned in the question below, I am not looking for research sources but rather a place where a person who is well versed in relevant law can specifically tell me what it is that I need to do. If this doesn't exist, then say so but please back it up with something more than ""I have never heard of something like that.""</p>

<hr>

<p>I am a computer programmer and I am interested in selling software online. If I begin doing so, I want to be very certain that all legal aspects of what I am doing are handled correctly. Unfortunately, I do not have thousands of dollars to spend on a lawyer. As governments generally want their laws followed, I imagine that they provide sources to find out what the laws are (as it is impossible to follow a law without knowing what it is (not that this is an excuse to break laws, but, it is a problem to be solved before going into business)). Am I correct about this? If so, where can I access such information for free? If I need to pay, the maximum I could afford is around US$100-$200 and I have many questions so I doubt that that would be sufficient to hire a good lawyer.</p>

<p>Some of the specific questions I have are (I am including these not to get answers for them from here, but, rather to give an idea of the sort of questions I have):</p>

<ul>
<li>How do I form a corporation (ie. LLC)?</li>
<li>How do I form a corporation without giving away my home address or spending money on an entirely unnecessary office space (I have heard a P.O. box is unacceptable for forming a corporation)?</li>
<li>Is a sole proprietorship sufficient?</li>
<li>How do I file taxes as a business?</li>
<li>Do I have sales tax obligations if I am selling internationally over the Internet (what about if someone in the same town as me buys the game)?</li>
<li>How do I properly shield myself from liability (even if I make a legitimate mistake and a customer isn't misusing the software)?</li>
<li>Since I am selling internationally, what obligations (if any) do I have under US export restrictions?</li>
<li>How can I prevent piracy of my software without spending (from what I have heard) millions of dollars on law suits?</li>
</ul>

<p>I have done a fair bit of research in the legal aspect of running a business (which is how I know I even need to consider some of the above questions), but, as with many things the saying ""You don't know what you don't know"" likely applies to law as much as anything else. Since it can go terribly wrong to break laws, I want to make sure that I get complete information from someone who knows the law well to prevent anything bad from happening. </p>

<p>NOTE: I am in the United States and I am interested in both U.S. law and international law as it applies to my selling the software to those in other countries.</p>

<p>I don't really want to go back to them and say they have no recourse, but we're a (very) small operation.</p>

<p>I've looked through some other posts, and references and looked up privacy policies and it seems that as a general rule people don't have any recourse if best practice has been used and the vendor notifies them if they become aware of a breech.</p>

For example, we are busy with 3 websites, then a new website arrives and needs to be worked on, then a client emails us about content that needs to be added, then more work comes in later during the day and before you know it, you have so many jobs to do and you cant remember which on came in first or which on iw more important etc.</p>

<p><strong>Background:</strong></p>

<p>I am a software developer and entrepreneur who has spent the last while building my own startups. I have a degree but not much experience working for software companies (outside my own).</p>

<p>I have had 2 significant projects to date...</p>

<p>The first was a startup in a niche market which has launched and is a currently running business.</p>

<p>The second was a mobile software startup that has reached a bit of a standstill. However, for this project, I attended an intense 12-week startup accelerator and learned about every aspect of running a software startup. (Sales, management, marketing, hiring, investment, ...). Learning all of this, and doing a lot of work, showed us that this product will take a while to be profitable.</p>

<hr>

<p>Currently, I am moving to one of the major software markets and trying to get some work with a growing startup.</p>

<p><strong>Question:</strong></p>

<p>What do you think are my best options for displaying these startup skills to employers?</p>

<p>I will give some of my thoughts to get the brains rolling.</p>

<p><strong>My thoughts:</strong></p>

<ol>
<li><p>Put in on my resume under personal projects. I don't think it would be ok to put under professional skills because I did not get paid for them. (Thoughts?)</p></li>
<li><p>Creating a slideshow (pitch deck) for myself in Reveal.js to add to my complete self-marketing package. I am used to pitching my companies but why not pitch myself.</p></li>
<li><p>Writing some blog posts on my experiences in these programs and with startups.</p></li>

<p>Here is the story:</p>

<p>======================================================</p>

<p>There is a B2B company which has been providing services for a year and has been, in the last few months, focusing on adding technology to their offering. The plan is to put more and more energy and efforts into the tech, turning the company into a tech company first.</p>

<p>The company has a steady amount of revenues from the services and is soon going to start a beta program with some customers for the tech part (a SAAS platform). </p>

<p>The CEO has worked alone in the first year, while the CTO took care of all the tech and turned the idea into reality, becoming co-founder at the 1st-year ""birthday"" of the company.</p>

<p>Now, the CTO believes they can work remotely (from another continent). The CTO also thinks that by being in another region of the world the company would increase their presence by having face-to-face meetings with prospect clients in that region.</p>

<p>The CEO, on the other hand, doesn't believe it is possible to have a remote CTO and is thinking of either convincing the CTO to remain or to change their role to a <em>C-less</em> one (e.g. backend developer, software architect, etc.)</p>

<p>The CTO doesn't want that and by not being able to be remote (as it was previously discussed during the initial agreement) that would be a deal breaker.</p>

"11051","How do I report my patent filing expenses on US Form 1120?","<p>My startup is a C Corporation in the United States, and it filed for a utility patent this past fiscal year.  Clearly a patent becomes a core intangible asset of the business, so its expenses need to be capitalized rather than deducted.  However, the patent filing process is lengthy.  At this point, of course, we don't know if the patent will issue or not, and the expenses related to obtaining the patent have not ended yet.</p>

<p>The startup already has released a web service whose method embodies the pending patent.  So my questions are:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Confirm: Since the patent is our company's own creation (see <a href=""https://www.irs.gov/publications/p535/ch08.html#en_US_2015_publink1000208980"" rel=""nofollow"">IRS Publication 535</a>), the patent is intangible, but not section 197, and its value gets amortized over its useful life, which extends until the expiration of the patent (typically 20 years after filing).</p></li>
<li><p>When does the useful life of the patent begin -- upon issuance, or the filing date?  (A book called <a href=""https://books.google.com/books?id=--pLHsdfhEoC&amp;pg=PA42&amp;lpg=PA42&amp;dq=patent%20amortization%20issued%20197&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ZrUkOoJxpC&amp;sig=iLvAcL-lT5JUDD_0wwSXGwIIfo0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiUjK64je_OAhXExRQKHWjSAFwQ6AEITjAH#v=onepage&amp;q=patent%20amortization%20issued%20197&amp;f=false"" rel=""nofollow"">the U.S. Master Depreciation Guide</a> suggests it's now the filing date.)  If it starts on the filing date, do we start amortizing it before we know whether it issues?</p></li>
<li><p>Are both direct filing fees and legal fees treated the same way?</p></li>
<li><p>Not all the costs related to obtaining the patent are known at this point, even though we've already filed.  Several months after filing, I paid an additional fee for the filing of an Information Disclosure Statement.  In another year or two, I expect to pay fees for the first office action.  Does each of these little expenses need its own line on Form 4562, with a different life span (the remainder of the supposed life of the patent)?</p></li>
<li><p>What would we do with the capitalization or amortization we've already done if the patent application later would get rejected?</p></li>

"11067","Is one to three percent of equity given to an early stage employees a standard?","<p>I have been working in a small startup company in Portugal (two owners and two employees) for about one year now, my contract is a standard employment (no additional bonuses or other benefits).</p>

<p>The company as few products, including two legacy systems (build buy another collage, which actually brings money in) and a new product in development (which right now brings no money).</p>

<p>I am working as the only developer on the new product. A part programming, I am involved in defining its vision and many other aspects. My role it is essential as expressed to me by the owner on several occasions.</p>

<p>Some background information: The new product is very particular. Before my employment, they tried to build an early prototype with no success. The company have difficulties to find good employees because of its geographical location, budgeting and technical skills set required for the task. I have in a very good working relationship with the owner.</p>

<p>I decided to join the company in the first place (with a below average salary initially) mainly because of the excitement to work on an interesting green field project with the lure of the possibilities of growing.</p>

<p>After my 3 months of employment I was able to negotiate a better base salary (still with no additional extras) with also a promise to receive more (not specified what) when the product will start to make some money (which could potentially begins in another 1.5 year).</p>

<p>During my first re-negotiation my employee expressed to me his worries of me leaving the company, and I believe he tried to be generous as much he could with his new offer.</p>

<p>Even if I have great excitement for the product and the working environment, I am aware of taking risks in working on this startup.</p>

<p>First of all I am losing immediately some income (calculated at 16%) compared with other job vacations which offer immediately better salaries and additional benefits from the start.</p>

<p>We are near to a a first release of the product, and the owner is currently looking also for an investor.</p>

<p>We are now in an early stage of negotiation for some additional rewards for my loyalty and risk taking in working on this project.</p>

<p>The owners want setup a new separate company for the new product and are talking about provide me a share in the company (with limited responsibility) for an amount from 1% to 2.5%.</p>

<p>My questions:
- What are the information I should ask in order to calculate my potential income, for example I am aware of a pre evaluation value of the company and forecast in the next upcoming years. What other key information could I need? Am I entitle to this information?</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Is a share from 1% to 2.5% fear and reasonable? Considering that I was working with below average salary with no extras and that real money could come in another 1.5 year.</p></li>
<li><p>The company seems really keen to keep on board on the long term, could be an increase of share related also to the years I stay in the company? What are reasonable values?</p></li>

"11068","Example of Immutable Share","<p>Somewhere I came to know the term <strong>Immutable Share</strong> which means that the share that is not diluted when new investors comes. </p>

<p>For example, lets A, B, C and D starts a company with owning 25% share each. Say 40% of the share of <strong>D</strong> is <strong>Immutable</strong>. Now a new investor comes and invest a big amount for 20% of the total company share. Again, (25*0.4=)10% share remains to D as it is Immutable. The rest 70% share is then distributed to A,B,C and D each getting A, B and C each (70*.25=)17.5% shares and D (70*.15=)10.5% shares. </p>

<p>Thus A,B,C get 17.5% shares but D still gets (10% + 10.5% = )20.5% shares as he has 40% of his shares immutable. </p>

<p>The same calculation applies to when any further investors come. </p>

D is given the responsibility to build and manage the developer team, taking care of the development of the product in a word. </p>

<p>Since D is working under less salary than the market standard and also giving more effort to the company than others, he is offered company equity by A, B and C. </p>

<p>D's equity is totally sweat equity, so he is concerned about the dilution of his shares when more investment comes to the company. Can he claims immutability of his equity? I mean, can he claim that some portion of his share will not be diluted at equal proportion to the other shareholders? </p>

"11091","Business Plan Software Product / Service","<p>I am a developer with expertise in document management. I have written both document management and litigation review (lot of commonalities to document management).  Azure has recently added Search and Machine Learning and is perfect platform for some stuff I want to do. I would write directly to specific Product (E.G. SQL Azure, Blob storage) not buy a virtual server. You get a lowest cost. Potential customer would have those Azure services in their name. They can backup using Azure products. I don't touch the data - I don't want to touch the data. A challenge is my target customer(s) would need to be huge. If you have a cost advantage of $1 / gb / month then it has to be TB of data to make a difference. I have some good demo data - easy to show the value of the software. Something like a hospital, health care provider, or data broker. Not targeted for a commercial store front. For something like data extortion hacks cloud is actually safer. The target is lots of data,  they want a cloud model, and they want total control.  Since I would need to release my software to the customer (with proper license) I do not want to test / build the market with smaller customers. Even with a proper license people will steal your IP.</p>

<p>I would rather control cost and minimize risk and making a living than swing for the fence for big payout.  It would cost me very little more than my time.  In a development and demo environment my Azure cost would be less than $50.  It would take me about 6 months as I know the design and exactly how I want to do it.  Not saying prior software is trashy just this is enough different that I want to start fresh and I need really clean code if it is going to be potentially be released to the customer.</p>

<p>Possible exit strategies</p>

<ul>
<li>Hope for a big boy to just buy me out. Ownership of the software.  Swing for the fence.</li>
<li>Try and license to some big provider(s). Biggest concern is
protecting my IP and liability. In a dispute on a license right
now.  Would have high cost in attorney fees.  Not just initial license but providers would want to review the license with my attorney.</li>
<li>Sell direct to small companies is not an option. It has to be in the
TB range. The product is not the same as a GoogleDocs but you can get
10 gb on GoogleDocs for free.</li>
<li>A model that looks attractive is Open Source via something like
GitHub

<ul>
<li>It seems to limit my risk </li>
<li>Low legal cost. Many tested licenses for free</li>
<li>I get customers to test </li>
<li>If customers hate it I will find out early</li>
<li>Developers to test  </li>
<li>I am more a back end guy.  In an ideal world would get font end guy (or girl) to join in.</li>
<li>I will actually start with WPF client. It is about speed and features. So much more you can do with a full .NET behind you. For one recoverable data loader.  With a WCF service could also do Explorer integration. It would be if an ASP.NET or ASP.NET MVC joined in. </li>
<li>I see other companies do it. Alfresco one of the big players does it.
What they typically don't include is options to scale and I can't do
that. Azure provides the scale and I have no means of withholding
that. But I still like the model.</li>
<li>I could sell related software services. I think I can even sell
warranties / support. Different business domains would have different
needs and likely want some tweaks to the UI. I think big cloud
customers will be more likely to go with Open Source as it is a data
security thing - total control. If I can get $10,000 in consulting or warranty from 10 accounts in a year that is $100,000. I am happy with that. </li>
<li>I guess a startup that wants to manage the business side might offer to bring me on as the tech guy. I don't really want to be the lead tech guy. I am a back end.</li>

<p>Furthermore, I think there is also a tax on the LLC's profit (on top of this 300?), because <a href=""https://www.delawareregisteredagent.com/how-to/non-us-delaware-llc-corporation"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a>, I read: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As a non-US resident, your Delaware LLC will only be taxed in the US
  on income from US sources, meaning that income from other countries
  will not be taxed by the US. If you choose to form an LLC, any profits
  US-sourced income will be taxed by 30%. This 30% goes to the IRS. At
  the end of the year, you will file your US taxes on Form 1040-NR with
  the actual amount due. If the amount due is less than the 30%
  initially taxed, the IRS will issue a refund in the amount overpaid.
  To make sure the LLC is sending the proper amount to the IRS, the LLC
  must designate a tax withholding agent to calculate the proper amount
  that must be sent to the IRS before any of the money is released.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So if she lives outside of the US and I let her clients pay her US LLC account. Does this count as ""income from other countries""? And where is this income taxed? Obviously she pays personal income tax wherever she currently lives (UK etc), but corporate profit seems to be something else. I know that if she lives in anther state in the US she needs to register the business there, but I am unsure what to do when living abroad: does she need to register the LLC in the UK? </p>

<p>This way their monthly pay can be more organised, with monthly payments rather than sporadic pay from their various clients. As the business is registered in a tax haven they will also receive the full amount of pay without tax. The business is profitable because it charges a small fee for the service.</p>

<p>I applied that new method for >500 classes (about 500 teaching hours, each class has about 4 students, so I taught my method to about 2000 students)</p>

<p>I then advertised on Adword, one student contacted me. He said he liked my method but then he never called me back.</p>

<p>In Adword, I got one campaign &amp; just 2 text-ads &amp; the text-ads are very specific &amp; Keywords are very relevant. For example, the text ads said ""Method A- a unique &amp; very effective way to learn English"". The click Through Rate in Adword is very high about 2%. That means for each 100 impressions, there were 2 visitors click on our ads. </p>

<p>The landing page is my homepage where I got a video telling about my new method.</p>

<p>Checked in Google Analytics,  Bounce rate=100% &amp; Duration=0.</p>

<p>Then I removed all old text-ads &amp; added new text-ads. This time the landing page is the page that lead visitors to an exercise that reflects my method. Now, this time, in Analytics, Bounce rate=50 or 60% &amp; Duration=10 secs or 20 secs.</p>

<p>But no one signed up or called me.</p>

"11248","Using opensource or freeware code inside marketable product","<p>I am currently trying to come up with a senior project for college and would like to make something that is marketable to help recoup costs of school and projects.</p>

<p>One of the biggest suggestions I have had throughout college is to not do something that somebody else has already done.</p>

<p>This makes me wonder, what are the barriers on using freely posted code/circuits in a product to be marketed?  It seems it would be wrong to use code posted publicly or open for use and make money off of it.</p>

<p>Are there written or unwritten rules on what I can use for a marketable product, how much freely posted code or circuits, a ratio, anything of that sort?
Code on GitHub usually has releases on it that I could read for that specific topic, but what about blogs or Instructables, or stuff of that type?</p>

"11253","Is it time to pivot or stick?","<p>I’m currently running software company focuses on niche market. I’m currently selling Student Information System software to small private school. The software can be customized based on user needs. However, after running for 6 month, I felt that selling to small private school is very costly. They liked the idea actually but pricing seems to be a big problem for them. They have such a lot of requirement and customization however they don’t have budget like big private/public school. For example, some of small private school have a very flexible schedule so we need to do a lot of customization work. Big public/private school are better because they have clear process and requirement. </p>

<p>With such thing, what is your opinion? Should I continue doing this or pivot to something else (creates software for manufacturing companies for example). I don’t want to sell to big private/public school because markets are too saturated. Is 6 month is too early to decide to pivot?</p>

"11319","Spend time creating product validation page or start coding product?","<p>So I have an idea and think there is a good space in the market for it.</p>

<p>I have been told by my Product Manager friend that I need to validate first etc through landing page process and tweaking product info/pricing via A/B etc. I don't disagree.</p>

<p>I'm kind of at odds though because the time spent creating my product page and setting up analytics is time I could be coding. I'm probably going to use Wordpress and Google Analytics for product page as those landing page services are expensive after one month. I plan on running the product page/validation for a few months and will campaign to drive traffic. The money would be better spent on traffic that a landing page provider. So that's why there will be a bit of extra work in the website setup. That said it is all new and I will learn loads from it. I have no problem pumping out code and creating the product.</p>

<p>I understand the reason for validating first but i'm not sure if my friend is only saying this as in his professional setting he would have to do this first because he cannot code. So in his case, paying for development before any kind of validation is just silly.</p>

<p>In my case though I can do both myself and time is the only cost. So it costs the same to create the product or do validation. Not completely like for like, but you get the gist right?</p>

<p>Right now I think I will go with validation and roll my own website (templates + GA + WordPress). Over the course of a couple of months I can validate and try and gain requirements. All this stuff will need to be done once the actual product is ready anyway and I can be gaining SEO/Traffic/customer enquires while coding the actual product.</p>

He is serving a very small market niche and had the money so rather than do the original job. We decided I would come work for him at a reduced rate and then I would get 10% of the company. </p>

<p>I moved my wife and I as close as I could get to the small remote town and then started commuting daily to work. Originally I was supposed to have Fridays off to wrap some other work I had at the time up. This never happened. Additionally contracts were never signed because every time the issue was brought up he would deffer the issue. He did present me with a contract at one point but it was purely an employment contact and I was not going to sign that. Yes, I know I should not do work without getting signed documents.</p>

<p>So I spent the next 10 months developing the website and making it work just as he wanted. That being said I was really done in about 3 months because I had been working on it in my own time an additional 2 months before moving. Instead of launching right away he would come up with complete changes that had to be done to the entire layout/functionality for the additional time. Each time I would meet the request at times with a lot of apprehension because the process was taking so long and was completely frustrating because the product could be launched and we could be making money during development, but instead I was subjected to what started out as monthly and toward the end became weekly meetings that were nothing more than him coming to my office to tell me about how much the project was costing him and his ""investors"" (his parents which owned the parent company). Then 2 weeks before he ""launched it"" I got taken into his office and was told ""We don't need you anymore""...</p>

As I said there, I work for a startup which is self-funded by a wealthy founder. For a few years before we received external investment, we presumably received injections of cash from the founder to keep the company running. During this time, the fair market value of our shares remained at a few cents. Should I assume that each time the founder injected cash into the company, the equivalent number of shares (new investment / fair market value) was created, thus diluting all other shareholders? Or put another way, can I calculate a rough upper bound on the number of shares the founder owns by taking all our spending prior to external investment and dividing by the fair market value of the shares?</p>

<p>I realize that as a shareholder, the short answer is to just ask the company to open their books. But the company is extremely secretive and I imagine I'd have to file a lawsuit to get the information, which would put me in a tough position as a current employee.</p>

"11415","Managing fixed costs of a stagnant mobile app","<p>I'm developing a mobile application that will generate revenue through the purchase of downloads. No ads, no in-app purchases, just purchases of the app itself. If the number of active users is above a certain quantity, there comes a monthly cost associated with the backend database service (BaaS) that the core feature of the app is built around. The more people using, the higher the monthly costs of utilizing the BaaS. </p>

<p>My problem is this: If every consumer in the market for this app buys it and uses it avidly, how do I prevent that revenue from bleeding away to zero due to the constant monthly costs of the BaaS. </p>

<p>It seems to me that the only economical thing to do is to sell as many downloads as possible until the rate of new download revenue falls below those BaaS costs, and then cancel the BaaS service altogether. This will ruin the value of the product to those that bought it, but it will protect the revenue that was generated from being eroded. I can't think of any suitable alternatives to this.</p>

<p>I have a company that has never traded since it was initially created, and won't be trading for at least another three months. However, I was on the Government's website and they had a bit of a contradiction, which made the entire message a bit vague.</p>

<p>I.e.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>When your company or organisation has not yet started trading</strong>
  HMRC considers that your company or organisation has not yet become active or started trading if it has not yet engaged in any business activity (business activity means carrying on a trade or profession, or buying and selling goods or services with a view to making a profit or surplus).</p>

I was considering Tableau for analytics and AWS for storage. Cost for these is not a huge issue, since the data we are providing comes with a very nice margin.</p>

<p>I'm putting together a 5-year plan, and I am running into trouble identifying the types and numbers of roles I will need.  Aside from the administrative and C-level roles, what fundamental roles will I need to fill in order to go to market and scale up?</p>

<p>We currently have 5 founders with a lot of various experience that's relevant and essential to what we do, but handling large data sets and providing analytics is not one of those talents.  We will need to hire, and I've been trying to take a stab at it.  Here's what I've got:</p>

<ul>
<li>Database administrator (2?)</li>
<li>Network Admin (x1? x2?)</li>
<li>UX/UI designers. I don't know much about this area, but I know I'll want to offer an attractive user interface and give a good experience. Looking at the usual platforms: desktop PC/Mac, iOS and Android platforms. I'm not sure how many is reasonable (2? more?)</li>

If someone thinks that it should be a separate hire, please let me know. I understand that this might be extremely conservative, and we could have 60 people working for us in 5 years, but I need a template that I can use to start with. This will help me plug in the numbers for salaries that I can then project out at least a couple of years (taking into account growth and new hires).</p>

<p>With myself being an experienced web developer, designer, marketer, and programmer, he's been asking for my advice on these topics. Throughout our conversations however, I've come to believe his idea may indeed be lucrative and I am leaning towards possibly getting involved in making it happen.</p>

<p>However, being an experienced developer, it also occurred to me in our talks that I could technically build, design, partially program, and bring to market this entire idea sole-handedly if I really chose to (perhaps with some outsourcing and management). I'm not sure what the role of my friend would even be, as he has no capital or technical skills, only the idea and a willingness to help.</p>

<p>I've gone through several startups in the past where the partnership came under stress due to me taking on the brunt of the workload and the other members' roles becoming increasingly in question, so this is definitely a huge concern for me.</p>

<p>And finally, it has just turned out that this idea isn't my friend's own idea either, but rather of his other friend (who I only peripherally know), and who is already interested in contacting me to discuss percentages of ownership and company formation (!). This third person, in my opinion, would have literally nothing to bring to the table in such a project, other than having thought of it.</p>

<p>I am very interested in pursuing this idea, but would love to hear any opinions on how to ethically proceed under such a situation.</p>

"11483","What kind of legal issues I might face by partnering for company registration?","<p>One of my close relative contacted me asking if I can do a 'Shore Interface'(used on ships for management) project for him in .net after that he started talking about registering a company under us, saying ""if required we can hire someone for coding"". Which makes me feel he only contacted me so he can register company with my help.</p>

<p>My concerns are, previously he did same project with his colleagues which never worked for them. These guys had big salaries, 2-3 times of well paid people. Initially they had contacted me to work on it but later they hired developers by paying them less than 1/4th of their salaries. Plus I don't even think they had any original ideas for this project, as I was given account of their ""future competition"" and they simply planned to copy it. With this they planned to invest one time in development and probably thought of earning millions. </p>

<p>The guys they hired had 10 year old coding style, they used table for front end template, had 'this website works best on IE at xx resolution' at bottom, their template had fixed sidebar navigation which will push half of content out of screen. Later I got to see the code and database, they used college level login where they check two textboxes without much validation and passwords were not encrypted.</p>

<p>So my first concern is what kind of legal troubles I might face just by partnering in company registration especially if he hires somebody like those developers plus he has no respect for copyrights when using images etc on front end.</p>

<p>I am thinking that I will ask him to pay me certain amount for first six months just for development. If he goes ahead with it and wants to register company under us, I am not sure what kind of contract it will be. If I am not developing then I won't be taking risk of registering either. I am not sure what will be the best way to say it to him.</p>

<ul>
<li>a solid MVP platform (a product I strongly believe, after the demo, could be quite valuable)</li>
<li>technology I'm comfortable with</li>
<li>a product I saw today and believe could be quite valuable</li>

<ul>
<li>highest salary, .4% options (15,000 options valued at $21,717 today)</li>
<li>$10k less than highest salary, .56% equity (20,250 options valued at $29,318 today)</li>
<li>$20k less than highest salary, .89% equity (32,000 options valued at $46,329 today)</li>
</ul>

<p>1 year cliff, 4 year vesting.</p>

<p><strong>So my question is about how to decide whether to take higher options or higher salary.</strong></p>

<p>I currently have a stable job and would need to relocate for this (from NYC to Boulder, CO), but I'm interested in their product as mentioned. The $20k less than highest salary is about on par with what I make now, so I wouldn't be losing much (Boulder is a 8% less cost of living than NYC), but am unsure of whether to go all in on equity. </p>

<p><strong>My questions in detail are:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>When we do exit (IPO or get bought out), I have the option to exercise my shares for the purchased price. This means I'd have to pay ~$40k to then cash out for a higher value. So the $ I'd receive is the share price at startup sale - my initial purchase price, right? </li>
<li>I'm aware of the statistic that 90% of startups fail. Yet, taking the highest salary is sort of betting against myself if I join. Moreover, it looks better to the company if I go for equity. Is it generally better to go in on higher salary? As the 2nd full time dev, I'd expect to be responsible for 30-40% of the dev work. Therefore, I want to make sure I'm paid.</li>
<li>We have a number of previous investors (some Angel), and the CEO has 30% share in the company- While he told me the board is aligned with his vision, he doesn't have controlling share. Meaning, the investors may be able to set unrealistic milestones. Should this worry me?</li>
<li>I can't get find much information on how much foreign language translation chat platforms typically sell for. Some chat platforms sell for 5m, others 50m. Obviously owning equity, this matters. Any ballpark for this could be helpful.</li>

We agreed that he would pay it in 5 instalment of 20% each.

<p>There are all kinds of people on the web who claim they can send you thousands of visitors a day, but they're all scams because the traffic they send is garbage.  I tried a couple and had more than 20,000 visitors, not <em>one</em> of which was on the site for more than 2 seconds, so there's no way they were real.  The law of averages says that if they were genuine visitors then even if it was a <strong><em>crummy</em></strong> product or service, at least 1 or 2 would have requested more information, but there were none at all.  </p>

<p>I don't care about building traffic for the sake of a good Alexa or Google rating.  I need traffic from people who have an interest in what I sell.  </p>

<p>I have a pretty limited budget at this point, so how do I go about finding groups of people who potentially would be a good target market, and then what would be the best way to reach out to them?</p>

I'm not entirely sure how this is going to work but I do know that: </p>

<li>We're probably going to end up with between 10 and 50 people total: Actors, editors, script writers, directors, sound people, lighting people, cinematographers, etc. We've made other things together before and the most people we've ever had for a shoot has been 20, with about 5 being the minimum. </li>
<li>We won't have money to pay anyone for quite a while, if ever. We'll probably have some small expenses and minimal profits. </li>

Do we just make everyone members of an LLC? Or do we need to give people stock in an S Corp?

"11546","I have a free web application with 43,000 active users. I got 300 to take a survey on how much they'd be willing to pay to upgrade.. What should I do?","<p>For context: I'm 21 years old and looking for ways to make a little extra income. Over a year ago I built a productivity web application that I've neglected for a while now, but looking back on my analytics I think it would be silly not to try and monetize my free web app. </p>

<p>During a typical day, my web app gets 20,000 unique active users and within a month it gets 42,000 unique active users and 5.5 million pageviews with 5 minutes spent per each pageview... </p>

<p>My plan is to turn my web app into a freemium model, where users can upgrade for a monthly fee and get better/more useful features..</p>

<hr>

<p>I created a Google Form and had 7 questions for my users to fill out and answer. One of the questions was ""How much would you be willing to pay to 'Upgrade' to have better/more useful features on ____?"".</p>

<p>So with 300 users who answered (which is a somewhat small sample size) this is the general breakdown (just as a sidenote, my biggest competitor has 2 million users and they charge $1.99/month to upgrade): </p>

<p>Not willing to pay to upgrade: <strong>75.2%</strong></p>

<p>$0.99/month: <strong>8.6%</strong></p>

<p>$1.99/month: <strong>0.7%</strong></p>

<p>$2.99-$5.99/month: all had <strong>0%</strong></p>

<p>Other (which ranged from answers like ""Depends on the added features"", ""Willing to pay a one time fee, but not monthly"", ""I'd like to but can't at the moment"" etc): <strong>15.6%</strong></p>

<p>So with all that being said, according to my small sample size, 9.3% of my users would be willing to pay $0.99/month, which going off of my monthly user statistics would be 3,906 users who'd be upgrading... which would be a lot of money, and that doesn't factor in the 15.6% who were a little skeptical, but decided against answering ""not willing to pay to upgrade""... </p>

<p>So I have a few questions for you guys that have done this before: How reliable is this information? Sure 9.3% said they'd be willing to pay monthly, but when it actually comes down to paying do they?</p>

<p>My goal is to make $2,000/month.. is it safe to assume if I implement a good ""Upgrade"" solution I'd easily make that based off of this survey? </p>

<p>Is charging $0.99/month my safest bet? What about if I had 2 plans where you get some features for $0.99/month but even more added features for $1.99/month?</p>

<p>I guess I'm just trying to figure out what my next step should be... Thanks for any advice!</p>

I also want to provide the name of my website to some agencies which are focused on freelancing artists, so the name of my website has to be easy to remember.
I want it to be the first step for launching a sort of personal ""brand"" in the future, so it is a business-oriented project and it may become a small enterprise.</p>

<p>The name I chose is meaningless but it's very very similar to that of a very famous director: the pronunciation is the same, it only misses the final letter in the written form.</p>

<p>In my opinion it's a very cool name, easy to remember, it gives the idea of some artistic and weird at the same time. </p>

<p>Now my doubt is: what does it have to do with my website and upcoming activity?
It may be a cool name for a weird photography gallery somehow but... it has nothing to do with selling graphic design, which will be the main content I want to focus on.</p>

<p>Given that XYZ is my website name and XYZO is the name of the famous person I was inspired by, when I google XYZ I get --->> ""Showing results for XYZO Search instead for XYZ"" </p>

<p>So given that I want to ask:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>may a random nonsense name, possibly similar to an existing one, be a good choice for a one-person enterprise or activity which is focused on showing and selling specific products, even when such name is apparently unrelated to those?</p></li>

I found a suitable name like that (the .com extension is available) and when I google it I don't get the ""search instead for"" suggestion because the name already exists and has a meaning: it points out a type of sweet/cake which, again, have no relation with my content but is cool, maybe less easy-to-remember than the previous one.</p></li>

<p>We have an agreement among the founders as to the split of equity among ourselves which is not under discussion. The question we have is whether to set aside shares for future investments. We want future investments to dilute all current shareholders. (There is no anti-dilution clause in the accelerator's offer.)</p>

<p>What is recommended in terms of setting aside shares for future investments?</p>

<p>For example, if we say the accelerator is taking 6% and the founders own the other 94%, if we set aside 30% for future investments and the accelerator takes its 6% from the set aside shares and we then get an investment purchasing 24% of the companies stocks, then the founders will own 70%, the investor 24% and the accelerator 6%.</p>

<p>However, if we set aside the option pool of 24% only after we receive the 6%, then the accelerator will be immediately diluted from 6% to ((1 - 0.24) * 6%) = 4.56% and us founders will thereby retain an extra 1.44% of the company (71.44% total).</p>

<p>Would the accelerator be comfortable being diluted immediately after investing in us (from 6% to 4.56%) so that we can set aside shares for future investments, and would we need their permission to do this?</p>

<li><p>Hire freelancers to develop foundations of it till it starts generating money and then quit my day job (i like this one but could cost much money)</p></li>
<li>Try doing it myself until it starts generating money and then quit my day job (might take too long as compared to hiring someone)</li>
</ul>

<p>So to explain those three points in short - as far as its an online business - software development will be involved (frontend, backend, Stripe etc.). Although i have a few years of experiance in software development, i have very little knowledge of overall Web development.

<p>The problem is that no one has published the press release. So it feels like a wasted effort.</p>

"11666","What is a typical cost of capital from a VC?","<p>So, I run my own share portfolio and have learnt a fews thing about the return of capital for various financial instruments but the cost of capital in the startup world seems quite detached from bond yields and equity risk premia.</p>

<p>Let me propose a simple model.  A VC wants 20% rate of return from a basket of 5 investments in startups. In this simple model each startup has the same level of profitability and same probability of success (unreal but this simplifies the math).   Each startup has a 1 in 5 chance of success, so the statistical expectation is 1 startup succeeding.  Because the money has been split 5 ways, the successful startup must carry the burden for the rest of the portfolio, so the VC must charge each startup a cost of capital of 100% to get to the portfolio target of 20%.</p>

<p>So is 100% cost of capital valid in this model (or have I made a mistake)?   Is this model reflective of the costs of capital observable in startups today?</p>

<p>[100% seems quite high when 10 year treasuries are at 2.38% and equity risk premium is ~4%]</p>

"11700","Startup offered me 5%?","<p>So 6 months ago I was approached by a friend regarding a startup idea he and another friend had. It was understood that, as there was no money in this idea yet, I would not be getting paid for my work until the company actually became a company, at which point I would receive a percentage of the company.</p>

<p>I was brought on along with two other friends of mine, one of whom did not work out and was later let go. I originally joined with the intent of being the front end developer (HTML, CSS, would assist remaining friend with JavaScript when needed). My friend would be the back end developer as well as JavaScript.</p>

<p>Fast-forward to now and I've created the entire front end, entire back end server &amp; database. The company (still not legally a company) brought on two more people, one that primary works as a market researcher (was brought on about 4 months ago) and a project manager (brought on this month). It may be worth noting everyone at the company (sans market researcher) attends the same college.</p>

<p>It was recently stated that my friend, the two other hires, and myself would all receive 5% of the company.</p>

<p>I have next to no knowledge or experience with this, but 5% was less than I had expected. Given the amount of free work, effort, and expertise I have brought to the table, 5% does not feel fair. Pair that with the fact I have done considerably more work than the other employees, and yet have been offered the same percentage.</p>

<p>So the question here is, is 5% normal? Is it fair considering the work that's been done?</p>

<h3>EDIT - Answering a few questions:<br></h3>

<p><strong>Does the company have a business plan?</strong>
<br>No<br>
<strong>What work have the founders done?</strong>
<br>They handle the entire business side of things. This will include talking to investors as well as marketing.<br>
<strong>Has the product been priced?</strong>
<br>No<br>
<strong>Will the company be bootstrapped (self-funding), or is the intention to attract investors?</strong>
<br>Currently being bootstraped, but the intention is to switch to investors.<br>
<strong>Has there been any discussion of salary?</strong>
<br>No<br>
<strong>Does anyone in the company have any business experience at all?</strong>
<br>The founders are in a business program at the college, I'm unaware of any other business experience.<br></p>

<p>Regarding the possible duplicate, while the main question may be similar, the situations are definitely not.</p>

He is a CTO, well-versed in tech, and has designed and created (through programmers) several great products in the past (internal, or business-to-business software). I am a sr. software engineer and have worked with him to deliver several of the aforementioned products.</p>

<p>Startup costs are negligible. What is necessary is that we both invest considerable time. Because this product is his idea, I have been offered equity compensation. Essentially, I would be a founding employee (not co-founder), and he would maintain controlling interest in the company (he has verbally expressed that he wants to make the business decisions but that I would have input). The highest number that has been thrown around is 20%.</p>

<p>My personal bias and valuation of what I bring to the table makes it difficult for me to look at the offer objectively. Based on the research that I've done, the idea for a product alone doesn't justify controlling interest, assuming that both employee #1 and employee #2 invest time and money equally from day 1. It looks like that's what is being advocated here:</p>

"11761","How should I launch my easy-to-copy app?","<p>I have an app idea that is useful but, unfortunately, really simple to duplicate. It seems that the best approach is to flood the market before anyone else creates a clone.</p>

<p>A few facts:</p>

<ol>
<li>My app will mainly appeal to people in their 20's.</li>
<li>It draws a lot of attention when it's used in the public place it's designed for. That should help it spread organically. (The only comparison I can draw is when selfie sticks were first introduced at VidCon, the annual YouTube convention. All these young video-makers saw people walking through the crowds with their phones on selfie-sticks, and immediately ""got"" why the product was advantageous and why they needed it! My app is not a physical product, but it has similar visibility.)</li>
<li>I've got a very limited budget.</li>
</ol>

<p>Given all this, I was thinking of launching &amp; marketing it like this:</p>

<ol>
<li>Keep it under wraps while it's being designed and built.</li>
<li>Create great-looking flyers or business cards to promote it. There's one simple image that shows both the features and the benefits of the app. (The flyers / cards will be used in step 4.)</li>
<li>Try to make it available simultaneously on iTunes and the Google Play Store.</li>
<li>Set the price at ""free"". (Later on, I can implement some solid monetization ideas.)</li>
<li>The day the app becomes available, have people through Fiverr.com distribute the flyers / business cards on college campuses worldwide.</li>
<li>Also on the day the app becomes available, ask friends &amp; family to download the app if they'll be in a situation where they'll need it. Also ask them to tell their friends.</li>
<li>I live in Los Angeles, so pay some good-looking actors to download the app on launch day, use it publicly, and talk favorably about it when asked. (Note: As I was typing this out, I realized I could do that same thing in other cities with a large population of actors, such as San Francisco and New York.)</li>
</ol>

<p>Doing a ""worldwide launch"" with a limited budget is probably ludicrous. Your thoughts?</p>

"11762","How should founders be compensated at a very early phase?","<p>Every startup situation is unique. How should a startup founder’s agreement be structured for the below situation?</p>

<p>I currently work as a software developer as a full time employee. I am roughly in mid-career. I have a good track record of successful projects.  I could easily “ride” the next twenty years of my career as a full time employee or software consultant.  However, I have been hoping to become a founder at a tech startup. I am confident I can contribute technical know how and implementation.  It has to be be a venture I believe in. </p>

<p>I having conversations with a guy from the financial industry.  His background is economics and some self taught technical skills.  He has a good track record working for various financial institutions. </p>

<p>For the last year he has developed some original IP on his own and wants to do a start up.  He is just about to start shopping his product to customers.    Although he has implemented some simple software systems, he now needs real software development to scale it up to a working system.  If his idea has some merit, this could become a business which is a wonderful thing.  </p>

<p>At this point I am interested enough to work on his technology nights and weekends for the promise of “sweat equity”.  I would keep my FTE status at this stage, and do this part time until this venture either took off or not.    I have worked as an independent consultant before, and I charged a good rate.  I know what my time is worth on the market.  It is more money than he could currently pay for a product with no revenue. </p>

<p>We are about to negotiate an arrangement.  How to do this? What is the best way to structure this as a win win agreement.  </p>

<p>I want to be fairly compensated for my time and knowledge and ideally take a significant stake in the future business as a co-founder.  He has more at risk since this is his IP and its his full time effort.    </p>

<p>What ever agreement we arrive at would have to work as we grow the business and maybe take on other founders, investors and eventually hire staff. </p>

<p>What should we try to agree on given this situation?</p>

It matured in time, and I have started to build it using my free time from the work, and weekends. So far, I have been building it through cutting edge tech, using AWS and scalability in mind. Currently I only had the chance to go through with the web interface and backend. The design turned out to be very sleek, so I have some confidence in it. It is not 100% ready to be in front of people, but I am getting very close.
My confusion is at what to do once I am confident with the mvp and want to release it. I don't have any savings. I am humbly versatile in software engineering, so I can build the IOS and Android apps myself as well. However I am losing my energy and health because of excess amount of coding. My eyes can only handle so much, and I feel like it is not gonna be sustainable for me to do the rest alone, once I am done with web site and backend.
I really believe in the idea, and I have come far, written quite a bit of code, so I am determined to go through the end. However I need guidance.
To guide you about the questions in my mind :</p>

<ul>
<li>When can I talk to any sort of investors ?</li>
<li>Is there any viable option to try release and get users without support from an investor ? ( Cheap marketing, or any other way ? )</li>
<li>Does it make sense to find someone else who believes in the idea and want to help me build it with shares, after I have already come so far with the idea and the main functionality ?</li>

<p>When choosing a business structure, LLC, S-Corp, etc: it can viewed as a process.  Assuming that one is in the USA: the <strong>inputs</strong> of the process include choosing:</p>

<ol>
<li>business structure for the purpose of IRS taxation filing</li>
<li>business structure for the purpose of filing at the state level</li>
<li>number of partners in the small business</li>
</ol>

<p>For this discussion, we can refer to a combination of line items 1&amp;2 as a <strong><em>'business-structure pair'</em></strong>.  Example a Florida LLC (1) that files as an IRS S-Corp (2) enjoys <a href=""http://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/101315/taxes-florida-small-businesses-basics.asp"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">state-income tax (5.5%) exemption.</a></p>

<p>Outputs of the process include advantages and disadvantages when compared to other choices:</p>

<li>Double Taxation (disadvantage)</li>
<li>Exemptions from annual reports, directors + shareholder meetings (advantage)</li>
<li><a href=""http://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/101315/taxes-florida-small-businesses-basics.asp"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">State income tax exemption (advantage)</a></li>
<li>Federal income tax advantages / disadvantages</li>
<li>Other TBD considerations</li>

"11810","Is this a fair offer? 10% over 5 phases (and other questions..)","<p>I have recently received a proposition from a friend to go into business creating an app which he has conceptualized and specced out over the last few years. I am developer with 10+ years of experience and I would be driving the technical direction and initial development as well as probably managing the dev team once we hire one after we receive funding after the prototype is built. Details still need to be fully fleshed out. He is not a developer but is a technically oriented business guy with a track record for marketing digital products. He has even started to build a prototype - since this will be a game and we are using Unity, he has been able to figure out how to do some basic things in Unity. I haven't seen this prototype yet though. He is more of a marketing, business and 'idea guy' who also may know investors. I'll have a lot more details on the 2 roles we have initially after a call with him soon, but I wanted to be armed with the information I'm missing before that.</p>

<p>He has offered me 10% over 5 'phases' he laid out, each phase he estimates would take 1 year except one of the phases would take 1-2 years. He offered that I vest 2% in the company per completion of the phase. As part of this offer, I would also receive 'payment/salary' after the first round of funding which would come after completion of phase 1 (protoype completion).</p>

<p>I have done a bunch of research and read on these forums that typically the way this works is a 4 year vesting period which is laid out <a href=""https://medium.com/@alain94040/founder-vesting-c214e86c59b0#.xann4jkda"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a>. I have also fooled around with the calculator found at <a href=""http://foundrs.com/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">foundrs.com</a>.</p>

<p>I have a few questions I'm hoping I can get answers to:</p>

<ol>
<li>Based on my reading, it seems a 4 year vesting schedule is the correct way to structure this. Have you ever seen this 'phase' based structuring? As a developer, I know damn well how accurate high level development estimates are, so I'm assuming no one actually does this and he's just knew to the software scene.</li>
<li>In a 4 year vesting schedule, when do I receive the first shares? If there's no cliff, it sounds like I receive the first years shares instantly? IF that's the case, that means that I would vest fully in just 3 years, not 4. I don't undertstand the information found at the link above and hoping I could get that cleared up with an example.</li>
<li>Based on a very rough estimate using the above-linked calculator using some assumptions, it came up with him being 74% and me being 26%. Does that seem about right to you? To me 10% seems very low! Considering it's just going to be the 2 of us for awhile until we receive funding, I'm not sure I could do this for just 10%.</li>
<li>It seems he's looking to control 51%, where I get 10% and the remaining 39% is left for investors and other talent. Does this seem right to you? In typical startup, does it make sense for 1 person to clutch onto the majority share?</li>
<li>He didn't lay out any kind of vesting schedule for himself. Does this make sense? It seems like as a founder he would also need to lay out his own vesting schedule as well?</li>
</ol>

<p>I am in talks with a potential business partner in creating a game/software company. He has spent the last 2 years in his part time fleshing out the spec for the game/app he wants to create. He is getting ready to sell his current digial media company to start this new one. I work full time and am very happy where I am making great money and plan to work part-time on the new business until there is funding or high probable path outlined to success. I am an experienced engineering lead with 10+ years. He has given an initial offer of 10% equity which is vested after completion of development phases which he estimated over a 5-6 year period.</p>

<p>I plan on countering him with a standard 4 year vesting schedule and also a higher percentage, as my research shows that 10% would be too lwo for a dev startup where I'm the only engineer (it's just me and him). Considering I have experience with hiring and managing development teams, as well as obviously developing software I feel my value to be higher even though this is basically 'his baby'.</p>

<p>I've done lots of reading on here and see freqwuently some posts pointing to the calculator at foundrs.com. I'm wondering: <strong>has anyone here with real experience in the startup world reviewed or looked at this calculator</strong>? Can you comment on its accuracy based on your experience?</p>

<p>For what it's worth, the calc puts me either at 80/20 or 67/33 split in his favor depending how the questions are answered (there's still some grey that needs to be clarified). I'm wondering if I should hard counter at 20 or 30%... but I'm not sure if that's really accurate. Again considering that I am the dev and it's a software company.. although he is taking much more risk since he would not be taking a new gig while I'd be still full time employed. Keep in mind: I am truly only looking for what is fair, and at the end of the day, this project isn't about the money. I have a real passion for the proposed app and I feel excited at the chance to bring it to the world.</p>

"11837","Causes for options pkg strike price drop","<p>I recently signed on with a startup who offered salary and an options package, along the lines of <code>""40,000 options** valued at $50k today...""</code>.</p>

<p>My exercise (strike) price per share was around $1.25 before. </p>

<p>Today we were notified we're benefitting from a decreased strike price to $0.30 (Exercise price per share), with not much other context. </p>

<p>I don't understand enough about options to evaluate this, other than the fact that a cheaper strike price sounds good to me. What would cause a strike price to drop? I'm assuming a reevaluation of the market value of the company (for better or worse). I opted for more equity than salary so this means a lot to me.</p>

"11869","Can you give me some hints while dividing equity with my teammates?","<p>Our startup has reached a point where it is critical to set well defined roles for each member and of course define equities or other type of ""profit"".</p>

<p>However my background is IT, not management, and this is my first startup, so I lack some fundamental knowledge on this.</p>

<p>1) About the equity itself, how much is it worth? What power does a person holding a certain equity of my startup has? What operations can one perform with equity?</p>

<p>2) I am also worried about equity dilution over time. Something tells me that at least someone should always have the biggest equity slice, even if it is by just 1%... But I dunno why exactly. Moreover, I bet someone holding equity can gather even more equity by buying it from other person also holding equity. How wrong am I?</p>

<p>3) How can I guarantee that all people holding equity in my company keep doing their work properly? I.e. how to avoid someone of holding equity and bringing no value to the company (becoming dead weight)? Can a strategy be defined in order to avoid this (in the contracts or so)? What happens if someone just leaves out of the blue and takes equity? How can I avoid that from happening, even if it requires taking all that equity back from the person to the company (if I have such power, it may be undesirable for the other members)? Also, what happens if a person holding equity dies?</p>

<p>4) We are 5 people so far, and I am considering doing the following equity division:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>member 1 (me) - 42%</p></li>
<li><p>member 2 - 18%</p></li>
<li><p>member 3 - 10%</p></li>
<li><p>member 4 - 15%</p></li>
<li><p>member 5 - 15%</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Does this look good? Or am I making some big obvious mistake here?</p>

<p>5) Imagine that for some reason we cannot divide equity that much (for 5 people). What can I negotiate with someone who will not have equity (or will have lower equity than he deserves) in order to keep things fair for everyone? (Maybe higher salary in long term?) What is a good replacement of equity for a co-founder? How flexible are these contracts, what can be agreed on them?</p>

<p>This is the hard part of being a CEO (specially, a very inexperienced one), where you have to make these hard decisions and even consider worst case scenarios (a co-founder leaving or dying). One needs to be cold hearted in moments like these. I hope things keep going as cool as they have been so far.</p>

"11872","How can I gain traction for my service?","<p>I know this is might be a few questions bundled into one, but please bear with me, it revolves around the main question above.</p>

<p>Our service relies mostly on user-generated content such as something resembling short travel blogs to identify good places to see. Of course, this requires the effort of users that have experienced traveling. <strong><em>How can we get people willing to generate this content?</em></strong></p>

<p><strong>Quora</strong> </p>

<p>While looking at the story of Quora, we read that in the starting days that the founders asked friends &amp; family to use the website, and those people invited their friends &amp; family to use it and so on...</p>

<p>Quora is a question and answer website. It's fairly easy for someone to ask questions. The effort is in the process of answering the question. I think most people find answering enjoyable, as it adds to their ego while being satisfied of being of great help to whoever posted the question, which is why they go through the trouble of answering the questions. (Please don't go bonkers, that's only my opinion here. Correct me if I am wrong.)</p>

<p>I think Quora's approach (with the family and friends) is very interesting and I would very much like to try it. Though in our case however, we do not have many friends and family that travel, and so not many we know fit our ideal candidate. We wonder if this would still be a good strategy to pursue.</p>

<p><strong>Bonus question</strong>: If we did take an approach similar to Quora's, we are also not sure if our family &amp; friends would keep producing content. Quora is a QA platform. Asking a question is easy. (and asking a <em>good</em> question is <em>harder</em>) Our user-generated content requires a bit more effort from our users. <strong><em>How can we incentivize users to keep on generating quality content when it requires effort for them to create it?</em></strong></p>

Needless to say this project is at a very early stage, we have merely generated ideas, I built a few prototypes (to which no IP applies), and we have not setup the LLC yet.

"11889","Should we sell our air pollution sensors to individual customers?","<p>I'm a co-founder of a company that provides:</p>

<ul>
<li>air pollution sensors</li>
<li>interactive air pollution map (website and Android app) where the air quality is presented</li>
</ul>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/zGIX2.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/zGIX2.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a>
The map is available for everyone.</p>

<h2>Background - what do we do now, how the problem started</h2>

<p>As for now, we have a business model for leasing our sensors to cities (the government in general). They are paying initial payment (for the sensor, mounting, configuring etc.) + monthly fee (for maintaining and periodically calibrating the sensor and maintaining our website). This business goes fine.</p>

<p>However, there are many e-mails from individual customers that are fascinated with our idea of distributed dense network of air pollution sensors and they want to buy our sensors for their location as well.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>There are few questions that I'd like to have answer for:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Should we sell sensors to individuals or just sell them to cities, towns etc. as we do now?</li>
<li>If we should sell sensors to individuals, then on what terms? Should we resign from the idea of monthly fee?</li>
<li>Should we show the sensors that would be bought by that customers on our map?</li>
<li>Do you have any pros/cons to add?</li>
</ul>

<p>We are just a startup. This is complex problem and any advice would be appreciated.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Selling sensors to individuals (in general)</h2>

<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>More money.</li>
<li>More active points on our map (if we decide to show them).</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Need to provide customer service.</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<p><strong>We can divide these customers into two cases:</strong></p>

<h2>People that want to buy sensor within area of existing sensor network</h2>

<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>They are near our headquarters, so possible warranty is handled easily - if something happens to the sensor, we can deliver a new one in the same day.</li>
<li>We can mount our sensors by ourselves, so we can make sure that the sensor is mounted correctly and in the right place.</li>
<li>We have better control over reliability of data presented on our website - with the dense network of measuring sensors we can detect an outliner easily and we can physically check if sensor is OK by going to the place where the sensor is.</li>
</ul>

<h2>People that want to buy our sensor and are far away from our dense network of sensors</h2>

<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Showing measurements from remote location where no sensors were previously may raise awareness of badly polluted air in people's minds and therefore attract city to buy more sensors.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Handling potential warranties would require extra time and resources.</li>
<li>We won't be able to mount the sensor by ourselves or that would cost us extra money, so we have no control over how the sensor is mounted.</li>
<li>We have less control over validating if the measurements are correct. However, it's still possible but in limited way.</li>
<li>It may happen that the cities won't be interested in our offer anymore because the citizens would buy many of our sensors in particular city.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Additional information:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>We've installed above 100 sensors and from that number about 1 sensor started to work improperly in about 2 months time.</li>
<li>One of our concerns are the users who can take sensor away from the location where it was mounted. For example, take it indoor. We have temperature sensor and we can scan WiFi networks, so it can be detected but in limited way.</li>
<li>We really want to care about quality of the data. We want to be reliable.</li>
<li>We are not sure yet how often the calibration of the sensors will be needed. We approximate it for about 2 years now.</li>

<p>Everyone else in a 7-person software startup has left the company, leaving me with 100% of the ownership. I've now completed the product we jointly developed and want to sell it. Can any of the co-founders make a claim on income from the product given that they no longer have an ownership share?</p>

<p><strong>Background</strong></p>

<p>I was a founding member of a software startup in the United Kingdom. At the start the company had 7 co-founders and was funded by an equal cash payment by each member. </p>

<ul>
<li>Four of the original co-founders left in the first nine months and
signed away their equity back to the remaining three co-founders on
the basis that they didn't have time to contribute to the startup
alongside their day jobs and didn't see the risk/reward balance
justified the investment of their time.</li>
<li>We then experienced what we thought was a major setback two months ago that would have required a major rewrite (taking a few months at our current pace) to fix. </li>
<li>The remaining two co-founders decided that they'd had enough and wanted to leave. I thought there was still value in pursuing the product. The final two co-founders signed away their ownership stake and departed. The exit of the final two co-founders was very acrimonious. The other co-founders blamed each other (and me) for not realising that the problem would occur. </li>
</ul>

<p>Every co-founder that left received back their initial investment in full as a means to expedite their exit. This means I've had to contribute more cash to cover the (very small) overhead costs.</p>

<p><strong>Current State</strong></p>

<p>I continued working on the product and fixed the significant problem (found a shortcut) and now I'm ready to take the product to market. I even have a few customers who are interested in purchasing the product.</p>

<p>My former co-founders are unaware that the software is working and ready for market. I am very reticent to work with them again because their past behaviour.</p>

<p><strong>Question</strong></p>

<p>Most entrepreneurs/stories focus on getting your product out there, making cold calls and getting investors - I have 1 investor right now, but I am currently about 5 months from actually having a product to advertise. I am in a partnership and I am doing 90% of the actual building (coding, design, etc) so (as in most of my past projects) Ive focused all my time on actually building. </p>

<p>My business is not growing, however, with me sitting by coding and 1 investor checking in. I would think to advertise because publicity is good, but Ive called some magazines and they want a close to shipping product before writing a story or something. </p>

<p>Im a minor and definitely still learning how business works, but is it disadvantageous to focus solely on building our product if you are the leader of a very small team? Should you be taking other, more administrative steps WHILE in development phase? What are some of these steps?</p>

"11931","How to handle payments, incomes, and taxes of LLC","<p>So my partner and I started an LLC. We just got an opportunity to obtain our first client. We want to make sure we handle all the payments and income so we can stay on par with the IRS. </p>

<p>Our financial structure, </p>

<p>Our company bids out a deal. From that deal, 5% is profit for the company. The rest is paid to the person doing the contracted worker (which is just us 2 right now) </p>

<p>In a normal llc, everything is passthrough. So say my partner and I split everything 50/50 and then we will record that on our personal tax forms. What we want to do is make it so we can do 50/50 AFTER 5% is taking off the top to make the company grow and handle its own expenses. </p>

<p>How do we tax the 5%? Do we tax the company itself as a corporation or is there another method of taxation where the money doesn't hit the owners banks. </p>

<p>Also we are bid on an hourly rate, how do we record that as 'income'. </p>

<p>Say we do $1000 in hourly work. The company keeps 5% or $50. We will then say that was profit for the company and at the end of the year pay the set tax for it? Or do we pay when we make the $50. </p>

<p>Then $475 each gets paid to us each. I will record that at the end of the year as a self employed income when filing for my return.</p>

<p>Is this correct? What am I missing?</p>

<p>Now say we keep the same structure. It's just my partner and I and we have a client. We agree that he gets 100% of the pay after the 5% and I'm getting 0% for not doing any work (as agreed). Is there an issue with our year end income being different given that we are 50% owners of the company. </p>

<p>What kind of documentation other than tax forms do we need? Do we need to keep records of checks and invoices that will need to be sent to the IRS or is it taxed based on my saying I made that much income. Are there bank statements that will need to be provided on behalf of the company?</p>

<p>Any insight is appreciated, like I said we just want to start off on the right foot with the IRS. </p>

<p>I told my co-partner the responses that I got. He counter claimed that despite everyone's suggestion to incorporate before we get funds it's still too early to incorporate because it costs too much (we will incorporate out of the U.S. which costs $2000) and neither of us want to pay for it we're planning to do a fixed funding campaign very soon so it'll help us incorporate when/if we raise money.</p>

<p>You guys know how things work. Am I a fool if I agree? We'd be agreeing to start the campaign with a cofounders agreement (looked over by a lawyer) but hold off registering as a corporation until people pre-order the product?</p>

<p>In the meanwhile my cofounder suggests to have the paypal account and credit card account linked to another startup that he's the manager at so we have a place to put the money. (No, I won't have access to the funds, only he would)</p>

<p>I would have to trust him that he is honest (I only met him once in person and FYI I found him on angelist.co. I have no reason to think he is a fraud but I don't want to be sued in case he is) so I am thinking that as long as I am legally protected and can't be sued in case he runs off with the money or squanders it, I might be willing to trust him with keeping the funds in his other start up and see what happens. If he is legit, after the campaign we'll move the funds into a newly registered corporation and go forward to make a prototype. If not, it was a good experience.</p>

"11965","Is crowdfunding a good indicator for a project?","<h1>BACKGROUND</h1>

<p>For this discussion, suppose a critical problem that affects travelers and it would effectively increase the cost of a fare by 0.3%.   The system is not directly used by travelers and is used by transit officials. <strong>Backers will NOT receive anything tangible.</strong> Traveler benefits include reduced travel time and stress reduction (i.e. 'not missing the boat').  </p>

<p><strong>Funding is NOT needed to implement / build the prototype or the production system.</strong> </p>

<h1>ISSUE</h1>

<p>I want to understand if the public is willing to support and not just glad-hand me when I explain the idea to people that I meet. I have not met anyone that said: here is the problem with your system and that concerns me.</p>

<h1>QUESTION</h1>

<p><strong>Is there any history of anyone using crowdfunding to gauge public support or is there a better way?</strong>  </p>

<p>I am contemplating starting a kickstarter, where no one can fund more than the minimum donation ($1 ?) and set a nominal target to pay for specialized software that would accelerate the last 30% of software development (~$10K).  The target amount is not important because money is not needed to fund the project  </p>

<p>If the project reaches a certain level of success, I would like to have the option to refund the backers.  <strong>Is there any precedent for this or mechanism to accomplish refunding backers?</strong></p>

<h1>DISCUSSION</h1>

<p>Q. If you do not need funding then why bother with crowdfunding?</p>

<p>A. The money is unimportant in the sense that it is not an obstacle to completing the project, however, it does provide a sense of whether the crowdfunding audience (and travellers in general?) would be supportive as a product stakeholder.  ASSUMPTION: A stranger that is willing to part with $1 is not glad-handing the idea / system.  The nominal donation is important in the sense that it weeds out glad-handing and is an indicator of public support.</p>

<p>If it were practical to make the minimum $0.25 I would like to do this, however, but I suspect the minimum is ~$5 because of transaction costs.</p>

"11985","How do purchases orders from buyers and the sellers terms get agreed upon practically?","<p>I have just started freelancing as a software developer.</p>

<p>I have just signed my first client. This was my first business contract negotiation and it was anything but smooth, and did not end up close to what I wanted.</p>

<p>I have little practical background in business. I had realised that I would need to create a contract stipulating the terms of payment after my quote was accepted. (In hindsight maybe this should have been specified sooner)
However, before I could send through a contract, the buyer supplied me with a purchase order stipulating that they accepted the quote and various items that specified the terms of payment and delivery. I was unfamiliar with the concept of purchase orders.</p>

<p>I then had to go through the exercise of trying to convert them from a fixed price order to an hourly based ""time and materials order"".</p>

<p>I had never seen a purchase order before. So I thought this was abnormal. I thought ""Surely I should be the one stipulating these terms to begin with"". So I Googled what a purchase order is and lo and behold it is indeed the buyer that creates the purchase order, not the seller.</p>

<p>Practically speaking at what point should I stipulate a contract with payment and delivery terms? Before I had provided a quote? Together with the quote? And practically how does a contract from the seller typically get amalgamated with a purchase order from a supplier? Maybe these are all the wrong questions and I have gone about this, objectively, incorrectly, and not how the world functions.</p>

<p>I am really confused about trying to mix a buyers purchase order and my (sellers) terms together and what process I should have followed to avoid the disparity in contract expectations. Essentially I would have preferred if he had decided to send a purchase order that is ""time and materials"", rather than fixed price. But how do I get what I want if it is typically the buyer who drafts the purchase order. I have included a link in the comments section to the kind of purchase order that I would have preferred.</p>

They offered me a deal: we will fork the man product, change its name and their developers will develop extra features for e-commerce websites.</p>

<p>They will continue to pay me for the extra services that I'm already providing and the new product will be brand new product which is not related it the current one as the claim because we will <strong>fork</strong> the repository and all the releases and development cycle will be different for this new product. I will take some money for my consultancy and also the relationship will be based on profit partnership, I will take commission for each sale and if I don't allow them to sale the product to a specific customer, they won't be allowed to sell it.</p>

<p>The main problem is that the new product that they're willing to develop won't be open-source, which violates the main rule of GPL. Therefore I need to license the current product just for them in order to be able to work with them.</p>

<p>Our company is also in the process of getting angel investment and I'm wondering if this deal can make some trouble to me later on. If I share my company's IP with another company, I guess the investors won't like it and the valuation of my company will decrease.</p>

<p>On the other hand, my product will be used my many enterprise companies which I can't actually sell myself so it will be widely used and proven software even if the name of other product will be different.</p>

<p>What do you think about my situation? Would the investors really decrease the valuation in this case? What can I do for the licensing of my app in order to avoid any legal issue in the future?</p>

"11992","Client refused to pay, breached contract after app is developed, just before delivery","<p>(TLPR - Too Long <strong>Please</strong> Read) So, we're a fairly new startup from India, developing apps and websites for clients. We've been working on this app with another Indian client who has suddenly called it quit without giving a solid, major reason. </p>

<p><strong>The Original Contract</strong> (and some changes later on)</p>

<p>We will build a Android &amp; iOS App for our client along with an Admin Panel. We will first go ahead with the Android app and when it is almost finished then we begin working on iOS app and Admin Panel. Client paid 20% in the start however we asked for 30 and the next payment was due in December which he said will make in January when the app is finished. We agreed to it. Client mentioned nothing about source code and discussed taking AMC (Annual Maintenance) from us several times. </p>

<p><strong>The App</strong></p>

<p>I cannot go into details for obvious reasons, however the app's idea sounded initially good, it later on became very clumsy and complex due to Client's irrelevant demands and when we told him that doing this or that will affect the UX badly he kept disagreeing. He has requested a lot of changes in the app from the initial scope and has taken it to a level when an app is in the market for a few years like 5. It is a full fledged app with annoying options and filters on all screens including Home, Search and Create Post. For ex: to create a post, you have to go through 4 screens, with a list of options to publish it. Login/Signup process continues for 5 screens. It's a pathetic app from user's perspective. </p>

<p><strong>The Client</strong></p>

<p>Not good. Actually very bad. Worst I've experienced all my life. </p>

<p><strong>What have we worked on</strong></p>

<p>We have finished the Android app upto 95% and is ready be delivered. iOS is in its starting stages with its login/signup flow complete. Admin panel has been designed but not working as of now. </p>

<p><strong>Who has what?</strong></p>

<p>We have the backend with us and the source code. They have the API doc, ER Diagram, an .apk and .ipa released on App Store. They also have all the design screens with them, all of it. </p>

<p><strong>The Current Situation</strong> </p>

<p>The client recently met a tech co-founder who is also a very cunning guy and lies to the client about us and the app. He pushes him all the time to take extreme actions against us and be rude, even when we're on a conference call. 
Now that the app is almost done, he asked for the ER diagram, API doc and Source code. I gave him the ER diagram, API doc but told him that the Source code is not free and that he has to pay for the added changes as well. On call he fought, shouted but later agreed and when I mailed him the same thing that this is how much you have to pay including for Source code, Admin Panel and Added changes he said to call it quit. </p>

<p>Me and my team have been working on the app for months and have completed Andorid 95%, iOS 15% and Admin panel 40% and now we are not getting paid for it. Being a startup the team was looking upto this project to get money from finally after so many months. But we've been screwed. The team who has worked their a** off without any money hoping to be paid, is now heartbroken and I feel really bad and am very angry at the client. The major reason for this is what I believe is his rat tech co-founder who wants to take the app under his name. </p>

<p><strong>What are my options?</strong> </p>

<ol>
<li>Should I write a mail to him explaining how we have worked so hard and how he should not do this to another startup, waiting the crucial, growing time of theirs. I want to be firm, do not want to beg. </li>
<li>Can I change a few things in the application here and there and publish it on the play store? Will there be any legal obligations to this? If I do this, I want to let my client know that I'm going to do this, does it sound like a good idea? </li>
<li>I either want money in exchange for this app (as in someone who acts as the client and takes the app in exchange for money) or I will run it as my own product with the same underlying features as sent in by the client. Can there be a legal case of Intellectual Property here? </li>
<li>Is there any other option? Please suggest. Thanks in Advance. </li>

"12002","Software project funding","<p>I've running a small software development business for several years. Lately I've developed, with my own resources and sleepless nights, a new product, I think innovative and unique at least locally, potentially targeting both B2B and end users markets. It's currently working, with a few users and sold projects to be started, but a lot of development is still required and it's getting difficult due to other compromises and lack of resources.</p>

<p>So now I'm looking for funding to finish the development, develop the brand, launch the product publicly and hire human resources (or be able to pay the bills while I do it myself?) for further development and sales.</p>

<p>Our access to bank products is really limited, only being able to get a really, really small loan. I'm interested in funding from other individuals or companies, both as loan or giving up participation in the management of the company.</p>

<p>Do any of you have experience with this? Have you been able to rise funding for this kind of projects before? From who (banks, companies, friends)? How do I even find potentially interested investors?</p>

<p>I've been reading other threads but the difference here is that I have a fully functional version, it's just that it still needs new features to be marketable and publicity and sales force.</p>

"12003","Can a company set a fair market value of its stock below what an investor recently paid in exchange for common shares?","<p>My company recently received external investment. According to management, they did not receive preferred shares; they received common shares like we employees have through our incentive stock options. Assuming this is true, I know for sure that the investors paid something like twice as much for their common shares as we were told the fair market value was soon afterward. Is this legal? I find it hard to believe the IRS wouldn't take issue with an investor paying $10/share, and then a few months later the company claiming their shares are only worth $5/share (which of course helps keep stock option exercise prices and AMT taxes down), without something significant occurring to reduce the company's value.</p>

<p>For example, Netflix's lowest plan was 2 DVDs per month at a price of $2.50 per disc ($4.99/mo).  Why not offer to rent discs individually for $2.50 per disc, and maybe offer bulk discounts to encourage loyalty and reduce costs? </p>

<p>Any thoughts on this?  Is this to reduce friction in continued payments? e.g. if someone is paying monthly they're less likely to stop paying in general.  Or maybe this model reduced incentive for theft?</p>

<p>Is it possible they were missing out on some customers who only wanted to rent a movie once every 3 months?  </p>

"12010","Startup Job - How to Approach this Situation?","<p>I'm a solopreneur with a startup that I've been working on for several years now.  It's mostly completed and automated. So, it's at a point where I can set it adrift to just chug along at its current pace and go get a job, or I could try to raise venture funding and grow it. After so many years of running at full speed, a salary with benefits sounds very appealing ... while having my own thing on the side.  I'm also at the point where I need more money. Despite being profitable during its development, this business just hasn't brought in enough yet.  The funding route may take too long, and as a solopreneur, I may not get much traction going that route.</p>

<p>I recently saw a job at a competitor that received funding several years ago.  They are a one-trick pony, but they do that trick very well and have grown significantly.  They are looking for someone to develop new services.  This is right up my alley.  Many of the services I've created would be a nice complement for them, and would thrive in a larger organization that has capital. While I see many jobs out there, this would be the easiest to pursue ...  especially since I've not been an 'employee' for six years.  </p>

<p>The  problem is that I don't want to share what I've already been developing for my own platform.  It would be one thing if they were to buy me out, however, my business is 6-12 months away from reaching a critical mass that would provide a decent payoff.  And, at that point, it would be more difficult for them to compete with me.  While this discussion may seem premature as I've not even applied for the job, I know that a job like this won't be available at this company 6-12 months from now. </p>

<p>The question is whether or not to apply, how to present my own business, or just to stay away until my business has reached a larger scale.  I will not be sharing the name of my company or website here.  I appreciate your thoughts.</p>

<p>First, I had a text explanation, but I saw, no one will take the time to read it.</p>

<li>Splitting the 9 min video up in tiny 1 or 2 min videos</li>
<li>Make an email list, and users who are interested get the information not in a single e-mail but in a series of emails, like the video up-splitting thing.</li>

<p>After 4 months a company that is owned by a big stakeholder of the first company launched exactly my idea.

"12083","Which is more important: Well Documented Service offering vs Good marketing strategy","<p>So I know the answer to this is - ""both are important"" - but hear me out. I am starting-up an online service business offering a range of remote services that would typically be done onsite with the main aim of reducing cost for the customer. The debate I am having is:</p>

<p>Is it better to have more people come through the website (targeted advertising) with an open approach to services where-by the customer can request work and I would then quote/verify if this is possible. Or would a better approach be the have a very specific service offering where-by there would most likely be a more restrictive advertising approach?</p>

<p>The reason this comes up is because the services I want to offer are very flexible and can include a variety of tasks dependent on what the customer needs. To try document every possible service would probably become confusing for the customer and also restricts how flexible I can be with service packages.</p>

<p>How do I protect my business from other more experienced people to start out? In particular, I have a really good feeling about the potential success about this business, and therefore <strong>would it be better to start out by creating a smaller, less successful startup so that I can become familiar with how things work and ensure to the best of my ability that my 'big' idea is successful?</strong></p>

Basically my web app allows users to analyse flow cytometry files from anywhere on any mobile device.

<p>The target market for the web app is labs/hospitals and universities. </p>

<p>I'm now at the stage where I want to market it. My ideas for marketing it are:</p>

<ol>
<li>use contacts to run a trial in a local University</li>
<li>find flow cytometry news sites and ask them (via email, facebook or twitter) to publish an article on my software</li>
<li>apply to participate in flow cytometry events</li>
<li>google adwords</li>
</ol>

<p>I spoke to contacts in the medical research departments of two local Universities and one of the Universities is interested in running a trial. </p>

<p>Regarding number 2, I quickly realised that flow cytometry is so niche that there are very few news site on it. There a couple however and I sent them emails, without a response as of yet. </p>

<p>Similarly, because its so niche, there aren't many events. There are only 2 or 3 major ones per year. I have applied to be part of these. </p>

<p>I've signed up for google adwords, so we'll how that goes.</p>

<p>Overall, however, I'm not making much progress (though I only started marketing it one week ago). Would people have tips for marketing software that's so very niche?</p>

Since research departments in Universities are a target market, is it worth directly emailing these departments? Or is cold emailing useless?</p>

Initially we were going to start an LLC together as three equal partners, but at our most recent meeting one of the guys wanted to just have it in his name because -- as he told us - if we moved away he could still have the business. Back story: it has always been a dream of his to own his own company, etc (as he has told us). It is so early in our moonlighting phase, that me and the other guy weren't sure what to say.</p>

<p>Also, the 15k he wants to split like this:</p>

<p>$3750 for him. $3750 for me. $3750 for the other partner and then $3750 goes into the LLC bank to cover, I guess taxes and what not? So, he would get $3750 as payment for work done and then another for his LLC biz. So, is that like he is getting paid double us ($7500)? Or am I understanding this wrong or something? If he is getting paid double, is it deserved maybe (e.g., like he is taking more risk as an LLC or something, or there are so many taxes on an LLC, that it would drain the account of that money anyway)? I guess we would function as employees / contractors too. Would we still have to pay taxes as employees or would that already be down through the LLC? Again, total newb to the business / legal world, so any help appreciated.</p>

<p>Also, this is just a hypothetical question: if we were to each just split it, say, evenly three ways we would each get $5000. Would me and the other guy -- who would not be a partner in the LLC anyway -- make more money, less money or no difference in money than if we go through his LLC?</p>

"12166","Crippled by lack of technology, poor employees, little experience and debt. How do I turn it around?","<p>Forgive me if the question is too broad or not appropriate for this category. </p>

<p><strong>History:</strong>
About 10 years ago a professional creator of content (music) decided to create the greatest sounding recording of all time. Basically it was a success. From that a company was born to sell this great sounding music to the world.</p>

<p>He is professional genius when it comes to the quality of the content as well as Business (sell life insurance to a dead man). However, it's fairly safe to say He is nearly retarded in terms of technology. This is where the problem started to occur. </p>

<p>He had the product, had the sales chops, had the friends to help build excitement and then we had to build an online presence. So we through together a bunch of random code build by random people and had a very very VERY poor excuse for an e-commerce store.</p>

<p>Fast forward 10 years and the store technology is the same, there's Loads of debt, the team is still only 3-5 people depending on who's helping out at the time and monthly expenses are double the sales revenue.</p>

<p>We continue to release product through this horrid shopping technology because making half of our overhead is better than none. because of such poor technology it takes about 30 hours to release one product. So the whole week is spent just trying to release something.</p>

<p>There are 4 main pain points stopping us from advancing.</p>

<ol>
<li>shopping system online technology</li>
<li>legal contracts</li>
<li>employee's with lack of experience</li>
<li>accounting and royalty payouts.</li>
</ol>

<p>The reason for the pain is that we are somewhat successful. We have an email list of 30,000 people and We have about 7,500 customers overall. And we were the first company in this niche to develop a retail store and sell products.</p>

<p>So, after 10 years of branding and training 7,500 people to use a certain site, it's potentially dangerous to change everything. Plus the amount of money it would take to build a store is out of the question. So after 10 years it feels like we are still in the 14-16 startup months of a company except with the massive debt.</p>

<p>Now we are faced with others with big bank accounts who have entered into the market (that we created), only their websites are $200,000 custom technology and are's is a $50 paypal connection that is incredibly unstable and could break at any moment.</p>

<p>Each product requires contracts to be signed and to have third party vendors agree to our terms. We have never had a laywer write these contracts so they are different every time and no standard contracts for percentage splits are setup.</p>

<p>Finally, the accounting and reporting system is so convoluted and takes such manual labor to configure, It takes the rest of our time just to deal with that.</p>

<p>I joined the team about 8 years ago as a very low level employee (trash cans and vacuums) and have been on and off the whole time; most recently leaving for 2 years and now back in a more prominent role. My job is to increase profit, simplify the technology, improve the online ecommerce system, and transform the company into a $50M business that can sell in 4-6 years. </p>

<p>My problem is with lack of money and constant anxiety about bills, whenever an investment or loan comes in it can be used in a few different ways and with debt one seems to be the bosses choice every time leaving the rest to continue to suffer.</p>

<ol>
<li>Improve online retail technology and innovate </li>
<li>marketing/advertising</li>
<li>pay current employees</li>
<li>pay the bills </li>
<li>pay past investors (framed as
loans)</li>
</ol>

<p>The money always goes to paying the employees and investors.</p>

<p>The very last piece of this puzzle is the employees. We don't have money to hire the real heavyweights surrounding us (past startup execs) or even freelance web development teams. So we're stuck hiring people passionate about our niche market and our product (which is good) but who aren't experts in a specific job. Example we have no expert web developers, no expert legal team, no expert marketers, no expert writers, etc... So we either train the cheap staff and hope they grow into a good employee, or fire people (and lose the creative juice and energy created from passionate people) and hire some freelancers to build the technology we think we need to improve and grow. </p>

<p><strong>My question:
How does a struggling startup recover from debt, when the debt is stopping the company from creating new products, innovating the technology, hiring true experts and finding new customers with marketing/advertising campaigns?</strong></p>

<p>In a sense, the lack of money is stopping a company who has proven theirs a market from capitalizing on that market because there's not enough money to get up to speed and stay inline with the competitors in the market.</p>

<hr>

<p>UPDATE: Plan of action steps in order</p>

<ol>
<li>Develop new technology on my own with some of my own money. Use
freelance websites and my limited knowedge to build a shopping cart
system that will save us time in the short term until a $200k site
can be built.</li>
<li>Fire dead weight employees and use their salary to hire freelance experts who can do work for us - accounting, web dev, graphics, marketing, legal contracts. (Danger is company morale when 5 person team turns into 2 person team.)</li>
<li>With the above freeing up some time, work on getting new products out. </li>
<li>work towards hiring experts who believe in what we're doing, want to be apart of the vision, but also have a specific skill we need (longterm company building to replace short term outsourced freelancers.  </li>
<li>investors. We have them ready to go lined up (about 5) but we never feel comfortable taking on more debt when we're in the state we're currently in)</li>
</ol>

<hr>

<p>Second Update:
We have decided (with my under appreciated guidance :-) to change ""elevator pitch"" to a much more simple message. It is was less sexy of a pitch than the original, but my impression is no investors will touch a company so convoluted. A simple clear vision for steady short term growth will stabilize the company and allow for realistic projections based on customer interaction. Since my vision and switch a few of the investor/advisors who lurk in the corners waiting for something to make sense have expressed more interest in our new vision. </p>

<p>The vision: We changed from trying to disrupt a niche industry and now are simply an online retail store in need of funding to build a better e-commerce experience. </p>

"12196","Proposing to support the development of out-of-box product","<p>I'm an individual with software engineer background and have an idea of developing a product. It's my belief that the product would address practical needs in a different way than similar products. Some company/individual could take the benefit of that.</p>

<p>So I'm thinking of developing this product myself however I don't think I could sell as an out of box product within a few months time because it just wouldn't compete with similar products. I would forecast years of development time for that.</p>

<p>However, certain parts of the product could be used as standalone tools. And those tools would be beneficial for companies. I could develop these tools in relatively short time. They could integrate into their framework or even into their products.</p>

<p>Actually, I'm looking for a company to support the development of this product and in return I'd provide them with the standalone tools and help them integrating it into their product/framework. Additionally, I'd consider prioritizing the development of the product according to what features they would like to see in those standalone tools. However, I fully want to own the code including whatever feature they asked and I implemented and so ultimately develop an out of box product.</p>

<p>Since I'm with technical background and without business experience I'm wondering how to put this into a ""Business Proposal"". I'd expect them to come back to me saying once I developed the product they consider taking a look and potentially buy. This is not what I'm after. What I'm looking for is a partnership and a little monetary support. I'm saying little because actually I have the money to develop the product myself in few years it's just I want their support,  feedback, and to keep in touch with company till I could hire other people to full-time work on the product. I'm sure they would benefit partnership because I could prioritize to add features that competitors haven't yet implemented (or they not even thought about it).</p>

<p>The work also involves research and documentation that I'd of course provide them and they could use that to implement their own solution.</p>

<p>How this could be put into a proposal considering (as far as I think) it's an uncommon situation?</p>

<p>TL;DR I have a business idea. Few years to develop out of box product. I want other company to support the development of product. In return I'd provide them with code/research materials and help them with integration. Ultimate goal to keep ownership of all code and release an out of box product. How to propose this to them?</p>

<p>As it stands, our engineers go to site and perform a consistently high standard of installations which results in strong customer feedback. However the one area in which we could do a little bit better in is setting a timeframe in which we attend and complete the installation.  </p>

<p>Based on the nature of the installations we do, the time taken to do a job could range from 30 minutes to 3 hours depending on the site. This makes time planning a little tricky when the engineer could have 8 sites to go to in one day. Furthermore this is why we cannot give out an exact time in which the job will start and how long their specific job will take until the engineer gets there. To mitigate this our engineers tell the customer, in enough given time, whether s/he will be with them in the morning or afternoon of the day in which they booked. </p>

<p>The exiting co-founder has offered to go down to 10% equity, undilutable and that he can sell it back to us at fair market value or to future investors. He has also offered 20% of profit each year be given to him in perpetuity and no equity.</p>

<p>Both options are unattractive to us.</p>

<p>The three remaining co-founders (which includes myself) believe he should get 1/4 of current company profits as exit compensation.  We also believe that the MOU is no longer in effect and that articles of incorporation are not substantial enough to demonstrate equity split.</p>

<p>We will be engaging a lawyer some more but I wanted to get the community's thoughts on this matter...thanks!</p>

<p>Update:</p>

<p>Thanks for all your comments to date. A couple things about this MOU: 
1) It references a company name that we did not incorporate with (e.g. it reference ABC Co. but we incorporated as XYZ Co.) Does that matter? 
2) It also has a line that states the MOU is to be dissolved when the company incorporates. Therefore, is that MOU even valid? That is the only document that talks about equal share splitting</p>

<p>They felt it would defiantly solve a particular issue faced by the sector and at the end of the meeting they discussed they discussed the option of moving forward into a partnership. The idea was that they would use the software in there institutes and then have it as an investment/business opertunity for their institute,  one of the comments made by them was referring to on selling and something regarding the Intellectual property (however I wasn’t too sure what this referred too due to my lack of experience).</p>

<p>My initial feeling is that they would give the product validity by backing it and using it themselves and at the same time help drive its potential success, and I would be the one to make and maintain it.</p>

"12294","My market research for this product doesn't show anything","<p>I'm moved from Europe to the USA and I'm little shocked that I couldn't find any businesses that provide what is so popular in Eastern Europe.</p>

<p>I'm thinking of bringing it to the US market and starting my own startup but first I need to understand why it isn't here. I don't feel like I would need too big of an investment to put in for this kind of store.</p>

<p>In Europe, there are ""fruit syrup on tap businesses"" that sell many types of these syrups by drafting them directly into the client's bottle. They also offer a bottle if the customer doesn't have any. It is very popular and people love it. People can make water mixes at home simply by just adding a small amount of the syrup and mixing with water they have a ready drink. They also sell vine but I'm not focused on that right now as that requires extra permits.</p>

<p>The stores look like this:
<a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/fJbTu.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/fJbTu.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>Now I understand that people in the USA are very influenced by brands like Coca Cola, Sprite and so on but there is also some prejudice that these soft drinks are not as healthy. Here is where I come in. With healthy, many times without preservatives fruit syrups, people can get directly from the tap and pay the amount they ask.</p>

<p>So I don't fully understand where the catch is. Is the legislative in obtaining permits for this kind of business very difficult? I understand if I'm selling an eatable product I need licenses and permits but I don't think it would be too big of a problem if I only resell and not manufacture it. Or people are simply not interested? </p>

"12323","Funding Options for a Start Up Company","<p>Software startup that requires 2 phase investment. Phase 1 covers the cost of developing the product and making it ready for market. This will take roughly 1 year or less. Phase 2 involves investing into the infrastructure to operate the software (as it is SaaS). Phase 2 only takes place once the product is ready and clients express interest to purchase. If no one actually wants to purchase it, Phase 2 doesn't take place - making things not as risky, as Phase 1 is relatively low investment in the grand scheme of things.</p>

<p>I'm not overly keen on giving up equity during phase 1, as this will limit the available equity during phase 2, where it is more critical. I'm also not overly keen on losing control of the company during the earlier months, as this time is rather critical.</p>

<p>I'm trying to find alternate ways of raising the required funds and I had an idea that I wanted to get an opinion on.</p>

<p>The current market competitor (of which there is only 1 significant player, who currently has a monopoly), charges for example £50k per year on this software solution. There is very little love to this developer and the product from the clients point of view - they will easily jump ship if something significantly better comes along (here is the market opening for us).</p>

<p>Would it be possible to approach a couple of these clients, asking them to fund phase 1, like a early bird sort of product purchase - much like Kickstarter, where you get a reward. We could then offer the product for free for a number of years, therefor giving them savings from licensing costs. We could also return their money once the product enters the market - perhaps even double their investment. Regardless of the actual rewards, all of this would be done without giving up equity.</p>

The app has a customer database and an admin area, but I've found that non-technical employees such as sales and customer success want to do stuff with the customer database that the app's admin panel doesn't allow, such as reporting or adding notes. Over time my engineering team has added some of those features to the admin panel, but I feel that using a CRM for managing the customer database probably makes more sense going forward.</p>

<p>I'm looking for advice. Which CRM do you use, and why did you choose that CRM? The biggest one is Salesforce, and the sales people seem to love it because it has every feature they need, but I'm not so impressed by the UI/UX. It feels like something that only salespeople will end up using, but not everybody else, because the UI/UX feels awkward and complicated. This will put the sales team on an island, which I feel is dangerous.</p>

<p>Who inside your organization use the CRM? Is it only sales people? Or also other roles like marketing people, account managers, tech support people, etc? Ideally I want a CRM solution that everybody wants to use, not because they have to but because it is nice. This way, everybody inside the organization always knows exactly what is going on with a customer which improves business continuity. Does anybody recognize this problem? Which CRM fits this bill?</p>

<p>Finally, how do you integrate the CRM with your app? Is the integration one-way (changing stuff in the app modifies the CRM, but not the other way around) or two-way?</p>

Just as a summary, this is a software startup, which requires £150,000 to develop the product, making it market ready. The initial offer I've been given from a potential investor (although only an opening offer), is 70% for them, 30% for me.</p>

<p>I know there are many ways to calculate the potential value of an idea. I'm looking at the current market and our competitor. For example, the competitor charges around £50,000 per year for their solution. The investor claims they have 30 clients that want to leave the competitor, who would come to us instead - this is part of the investors promise, financing and clients to sell to. </p>

<p>So, over a year, we have the potential to generate £1.5m in revenue. Who knows what else we could do after year 1. I also appreciate we may not get all these clients, especially not all on day 1. But for arguments sake, let's say that the value of the idea is £1.5m, based on the investors promise of 30 clients and the average cost of the solution that the competitor currently charges.</p>

<p>That would mean their £150,000 investment is worth more or less 10% (for easier maths). Maybe 20% if we can only get 15 of the 30 clients. I appreciate 10%-20% is rather low, but surely 70% is too high?</p>

<p>I'm a bit confused on what is needed to do business beyond my home state. Most online resources/docs sound like they cater to ""mom and pop"" shops with a store front. My business is the complete opposite. I'm always moving and on the road...the traveling salesman!!</p>

<p>The reason I'm asking this is because I've became aware of the benefits of filing in states like DE,WY,NV. I've read up a bit on the ""rules and regulations"" but I'm still a bit confused as to whether or not I could take advantage of these options. Again my business transactions are all online and I consult with clients across the nation/world, so I don't really have a ""home base"". I thought I could just have a registered agent in say WY, then conduct my business where ever, nation or world wide. Since my company is geographically unrestricted, should/can I take advantage of filing in states like DE,WY,NV?</p>

<p>In summary, I don't have a store front and want to do business beyond my home state. What is needed to conduct business beyond my home state and should I take advantage of filing in other states like DE,WY,or NV?</p>

"12374","What is the value of my company?","<p>I have been working on my start up in the enterprise HR tech area for the last two 2 years. We have a citizen integration inspired middleware that makes SAP integrations super easy. We have a cloud version as well as an installable version.</p>

<p>We don't have any customers insofar. But that's looking to change with 3 big ($6 bill+) companies looking to buy our subscription. Since we're in HR Tech, our subscription is based on the number of employees a company has.</p>

<p>One of the companies has 70+k employees and they're looking to start with 20k employees (a few of their subsidiaries) for this year. Per Employee per month is 30 cents: revenue is approx $7.2k/year and can increase based on employees at the customer to as much as $25k/year. Another customer on a similar note can bring in 20k more in revenue.</p>

<p>Now, by the end of last year, I met a very successful sales/business development guy. We worked together on a pitch for a really big software vendor. A deal with them can open up atleast 20+ such aforementioned customers in the next 3-4 years. Of course, that also means that we have to increase our man power and other capacities. 
End of 3years, we project :
 ///Realistic  scenario: Revenue $400k | Profit -$280k(loss)
 ///Optimistic scenario: Revenue $700k | Profit -$44k(loss).
 Overall: Revenue $500k | Profit -$150k | trend +
 But if we manage upsell other products/consulting, then we start looking good on the profit front too.</p>

<p>Now, the new guy wants to pick up a stake in the company. He wants to put in $200k for a stake of 35%.<br>
 His take: Without him, the company had no value and therefore he gets the first mover advantage.</p>

<p>This I believe is too high. What are the repercussions of accepting this?
What are my arguments to counter this and lower his stake to, say, 15-20%?</p>

We're able to quickly translate the app to any Latin language (Spanish and Portuguese translations are ready). </p>

<p>This is where we currently stand, and it feels like with more time and effort this can actually happen. Thing is, we are out of resources. we are no longer able to spend so many hours promoting and improving the app, and we don't have the funds to hire people.

"12381","Ideas on how to monetize a startup that intends to opensource it's products?","<p>I am leading a group of professionals from relevant but different industries; my role is that of a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benevolent_dictator_for_life"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">BDFL</a>; We are building a set of tools and methodologies (<a href=""http://opensourceecology.org/gvcs/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">a bit similar to this one</a>).</p>

<p>The choice of going open source is <strong>not solely because of altruism</strong>, rather it's because we believe the following:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>It will encourage more people to contribute and develop the products</p></li>
<li><p>The geographical areas in which we intend to deploy, will mostly be developing economies - and copyright laws are (shall we say) ""not as enforceable"" over there as in the West* - in any case; We want to actively encourage use, adoption (and possible improvement) by individuals, but don't want to see commercial use without licensing.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>I have a set of ideas of how to go about this, but I wanted to hear other ideas first, to see if I'm on the right path.</p>

<p>So, given that we want to opensource our products (mostly architectural designs and technologies for building low cost housing etc) - can someone suggest a way where we can monetize our activities? </p>

<p><strong>[[Note*]]</strong></p>

<p>It may seem I had contradicted myself when I said copyright laws were largely not enforceable in the areas in which we intend to deploy - and yet wanted to apply some sort of copyleft. What I mean however is that, I don't think it's worth hounding some poor bugger who decided to use our designs etc to build a house for himself and his family etc - they'll be too many of them to contend with in that environment, so instead, we'll encourage them to use, adapt the products and provide feedback.</p>

<p>On the other hand, we keep our gunpowder dry and turn our full fury on businesses who want to ride of our coat tails and profit from our hard work. there will be fewer of those, and we can focus on dealing with them in court. </p>

"12384","How do you evaluate key employee worth in small business sale? What is the appropriate terminology to describe this?","<p>In a small small tech SaaS company with SDE around $120k, the owner is looking to sell and retire, but does not want sell to the only employee due to lack of up front capital.</p>

<p>The employee has been with the company 12+ years, and is the only individual with recent and extended knowledge of the program (inside and out), as well as customer support.  A ""hands off"" investor is interested in the purchase the company, and discussion occurs on placing the employee in charge of the full operations of the company, while the investors could merely reap the profits.</p>

<p>For the employee, they recognize their worth to the company.  They are under no legal or ethical obligation to stay with the company, and could find comparable or even better employment elsewhere.  Further, it stands to reason that without a knowledgeable and experienced employee, the final sale price of the company could be affected, perhaps severly, as it is a moderately sized software package and no one else has recent and detailed, long-term experience with it.</p>

<p>It is a niche market, relatively limited customer base, and is a many featured product that would take a while for even a customer to learn, let alone a new employee to both support and maintain.</p>

<p>For the employee, who has very little incentive to stay, how would the value of that employee be measured, from all three positions?  The seller, the buyer, and the employee?</p>

<p>While there are few incentives for an outside investor (they could find another company), what are the considerations for both the employee and the seller, how tondescribe this to both, and possibly ethical considerations involved.</p>

<p>Should the employee just walk away, or refuse a deal with the new owner, the investors would likely walk away, and finding new prospects would be harder (it has been on market for 2.5 years already, and the owner is 70).  If the employee stays, without demanding something in return for his 'expertise', he would feel disrespected by the owner who feels no loyalty to reward 12 years of service to profit the owner.</p>

<p>Since the only leverage the employee has is with the current owner in the sale, could/should he expect compensation as part of the deal from the exiting boss, perhaps to secure 2-3 years of labor with the buyers, so that everyone is benefitted? The employee would just as soon walk away and find new employment as stay with the company, and the employers fate is of no concern to him.</p>

<p>Should the employee expect anything from the seller, perhaps even a substantial percentage of the final sale price, such as, if the company is worth 50% less if he doesnt go with a sale, could/should he demand a sizable portion of the company sale price from the company owner in the sale agreement?  Is there better method of valuation for the employee, and how would one communicate this ethically and clearly?</p>

<p>NOTE:  I am mostly interested in the employees position, both in verbiage as well as ethically, but am interested in the others as well, if possible.</p>

This article suggests the advantage of such a strategy: <a href=""https://www.foley.com/new-tech-start-ups-formed-in-2011-should-consider-llc-format-at-least-initially-06-09-2011/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://www.foley.com/new-tech-start-ups-formed-in-2011-should-consider-llc-format-at-least-initially-06-09-2011/</a>.</p>

<p>However, I was wondering whether the 5 year holding period for QSBS exemptions starts at the origination of the business in any form (i.e. the incorporation of the LLC in my case), or only when the shares are issued.  In other words, could there be a benefit from converting to a C Corp and issuing myself shares sooner rather than later?</p>

<p>For completeness, it would also be good to know how the timing works with stock option grants vs exercised options.  (I believe the initial tax basis depends on the value of the exercised option, which would lead me to think that the 5 year period also starts at that time.)</p>

"12410","Partnership dissolved by partner and then bullying by lawyers to force us out","<p><strong>Scenario: A preschool business partnership based in South Africa.</strong> </p>

<p>Our children go to a preschool that hit financial difficulties due to residential rezoning, which forced them to move which cost a lot of money. They received funding from a mutual friend of the school, but after the mutual friend's wife became terminally ill he demanded the money back and was granted an emergency summary judgement by a local magistrate forcing the owner of the school to pay the money within 7 days or they would sell the school. </p>

<p>The owner approached us with an initial offer of an 'investment loan' put together by her financial adviser and asked if we knew anyone who would be willing to do some form of bridging finance. After speaking to some people and getting no interest and being concerned that our children's school would close we provided the necessary funding. </p>

<p>The owner then asked if we wanted to become partners in the school since her current partner had decided that she just wanted to be a teacher in the school and not be part of the business side of things. </p>

<p>We accepted a 45% share in the partnership but for only around 1/3 of the money we put in. The remainder would still be a loan that the school had to pay back. </p>

<p>Towards the middle of last year our own business hit a bad patch. We approached the school regarding our school fees which we couldn't afford anymore to which we were told not to worry because we had a vested interest in the school. </p>

<p>The business partner had started deducting our school fees from the loan amount she paid back every month so we considered this to be a fair trade whilst we get our business back on its feet. </p>

<p>Two months later we received a legal letter dissolving the partnership and since then we have been bullied by the partner's lawyers. We put up a fight with the partner refusing to accept her terms which included our immediate withdrawal from the business and converting all invested amounts into an interest free loan. </p>

<p>On February 16 we received a letter from the school expelling our children due to their school fees not being paid (even though it was being paid by deduction) and they stopped paying back the loan. Our legal adviser told us to take our kids back to the school since the partner didn't have a legal leg to stand on. 
When we arrived at the school, a lawyer was waiting for us and threatened us with a child abandonment order amongst other threats. </p>

<p>We attempted mediation but the partner refused stating that it was too emotional for her to go through. </p>

<p><strong>Here's our situation:</strong><br>
* We have seen a mediator and two lawyers<br>
* We don't have the funding to sustain litigation<br>
* They have successfully forced us into a corner where we're going to HAVE to accept their terms.  </p>

<p>The law, I'm afraid, only serves the party who has the most money by the looks of it. If my business were back up to where it was I would gladly sue and make sure this partner doesn't get away with our investment/loan. </p>

"12413","Welfare, unemployment, government assistance as funding for startup?","<p>I've always been interested in startup stories and I've read about several stories how founders were on various forms of government provided social-welfare before they made it big. </p>

<p>These stories usually come in the form of:
""My family and I were on welfare, so I worked very hard day and night to build [insert product here] and I became a millionaire/billionaire.""</p>

<p>Once you look more carefully you will notice that they usually had the opportunity to get a middle-class job and provide for their family, instead they chose to chase their dream at the expense of the tax-payer.</p>

<p>I'm starting to see a pattern of people using government provided welfare as a form of startup seed founding in the sense that they can provide the basic necessities for their family while they work on building their future.</p>

<p>Some examples of the aforementioned  is the ""<a href=""http://fundersandfounders.com/too-poor-to-succeed-jan-koum-whatsapp/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">WhatsApp</a>"" founders (<a href=""http://www.businessinsider.com/whatsapp-jan-koum-lived-on-food-stamps-2014-2"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">WhatsApp Co-Founder Jan Koum Once Lived On Food Stamps</a>) and <a href=""http://www.thesquander.com/casey-neistats-net-worth/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Casey Neistat</a>, both of which used government benefits to survive while building their products/service/skills. I've read about many others and even saw a documentary about a beverage company that did the same thing.</p>

<p>Personally, I've seen two success stories in the form of a family relative who essentially (used...possibly abused) welfare until he made it big in his IT company. Also a now rich friend who lived in the projects and collected welfare while building his baking company.</p>

<p>Questions:</p>

<p><strong>Is using government welfare/unemployment knowing that you can get a new job, but refuse to do so by stating ""the job wasn't a good fit"" legal? Clearly, you are not forced to take the first job offer while on unemployment.</strong></p>

<p><strong>If you become successful, do you have to pay back that welfare money?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Is this morally correct?</strong></p>

<p><strong>If I have the opportunity to provide my family the basics by living at my parents home while collecting welfare, unemployment, food-stamps, medicade, and so on.

We're an an early-stage company, targeting small and medium companies. We're in software development market, connecting AI Chatbot Developers with businesses. Our business model is ""marketplace"", we charge developers some commission.</p>

<li>The market is new and we spend lots of time educating the potential customers, in hope one dat they will come back or recommend us.</li>

<li><p>Or I should provide a re-new plan for the solution each year?</p></li>

Unfortunately, like many others we do not have any signed agreements (I know it was a red flag when he refused to sign one from the start, but you think the people you care about will not hurt you.)  So, please do not make comments about not having an agreement, I get it but, that is irrelevant to helping my current situation.  </p>

<p>One company is a 50/50 LLC. (Landscaping)  We have tried to pay everything 50/50 in the past but, things here and there were paid separate.  Main insurance and bills however, were always split 50/50.  There are about 45 clients at this time.  And we were working it that the jobs each of us worked were what we were paid on, not automatic 50/50 splits on profits  Him and I do not see eye to eye on a lot of things and it has just become unhealthy, and he now refuses to cooperate on anything except his terms.  I want to get out but, he refuses to buy me out stating he doesn't need to because he has a set-up that works for him.  There is equipment for example one large item in my name and I have the title but, we have both been paying 50/50 for every month that is on the table. (I do not have the capacity to pull such item so unless I rely on him I make no profit off of it)  I believe legally that item is still mine if I wanted to up and sell it correct? (Of course I would do the correct thing and pay him half the profit it sold for)  What if I just stop paying my 50% of the bills.  Also being 50% partner am I automatically entitled to 50% of the profits even if I don't work.  That is not my intent I am not a freeloader but, my back is against the wall.<br>
And anything I do with this company will automatically negativly affect me with the other company because he is 51% (I KNOW, I SHOULD HAVE NEVER TRUSTED. BUT, HE WOULDN'T HAVE SIGNED AN AGREEMENT ANYWAY, AND I DID NOT HAVE ANY MONEY FOR A LAWYER).</p>

<p>This is the sentence in WrapBootstrap License talking about the Commercial Usage with Single Application License. This issue is not only related to WrapBootstrap but also to many other websites like (Envato Market, Bootstrap Made and others..):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>this license grants you a non-exclusive and non-transferable right to use and incorporate the item in your personal or commercial projects.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The definition of commercial usage is having a profit from the website. Website can have profit through <strong>Advertisement, monthly fee, subscriptions, donations and others..</strong></p>

<p>This type of website are also defined from others as Software as a Service.</p>

<li>Do not accept ""growing into"" a CTO role part-time. Either there are clear requirements from the start what the CTO will be responsible for, or you are better off walking away.</li>
<li>If there is no budget from the start, that shows that the business owners are simply not that business-minded, and hence, another reason to walk away.</li>

"12572","When is my startups ""anniversary date""?","<p>Here is my backstory. I created an S corp 4 years ago. Soon after getting everything squared away I officially opened for business. My original plan was to provide some creative services online. After 2 months of inactivity I, for lack of a better term, abandoned the startup. About a year after that I pivoted and began research regarding possibly providing a new type of service, but that was left behind too without ever opening for business. So 2-3 years have passed with it sitting inactive, but I'm finally going to ""reopen"" with a new idea. In those 2-3 years I have matured greatly and have strong evidence that I'll begin generating strong revenue in the next 2-3 months.</p>

<p>My question is when is my ""startup anniversary""? Should I consider that my business paperwork filing date, when I first opened for business 4 years ago, or my most recent ""launch date""?</p>

<p>Also, is there anything else I should worry about down the road? For example if I am interviewed about the company or seek fundinf what should I say about the ""early years"", that I wasn't commited?</p>

<li>I am in the USA</li>

There seems to have been 0 monetary profits coming to us for almost a year however the daily take is always VERY good. He has almost been raising prices, lowering quality, firing staff, cutting hours.. continues to complain about minimum wage going up etc etc. I also have been told by a manager that he has been taking money without myself or the silent partner knowing and have proof that not all money has been going into the back (for example march 20th cash was $20K but only $14K was deposited!?!)</p>

<p>A couple of days ago our book-keeper/lady who takes care of the bills, licenses and banking handed in her notice. He is now trying to pressure me into taking on her role (with no additional salary). I am not comfortable in doing so as I'm not a trained accountant, have no experience in book keeping and quite frankly do not want to be liable IF he is doing anything under handed. </p>

<p>We signed a personal contract in 2011 which states how much money I gave him in exchange for the 10% and we both signed it, dated it etc. </p>

"12740","design for sw product BUT no skills to run a company. Is there a path to getting this done in VC world","<p>my first question on this forum so please be gentle.</p>

<p>I am a technician and as such have spent time to make sure that my concept can be implemented using the next generation software and hardware. I have the environment to draw on talent as I am in Chicago and live near IIT, UIC and have contacts in Northwestern. I have SOME skills in VC world as my first startup was with Kleiner Perkins and Tom Perkins was our chairman. 
BUT 
I have NO allusions that I could run a company OR a desire to do so. I would like to present my idea to a trustworthy and interested group of people and have them fund and run the company with me taking some compensation for the idea, the initial design and for ongoing guidance.  </p>

<p>I have NO idea how the funding world works these days or how to approach anyone in Chicago as to how to start this discussion. If it were the valley this would not be a problem but in Chicago I have no idea as to where to start. </p>

<p>Is this a situation that is common place OR a non starter as any VC company would need the ""founder"" to fully invest all their time in their idea?

"12749","Is there any point in waiting to get my equity if the company is almost dead?","<p>This is a question regarding speculation and the bubble in the startup world.</p>

<p>I work for a very small startup. As part of my contract, I got a stock option plan that granted me the right to buy 4% of the company for 40€ after two years as employee.</p>

<p>It's been almost 18 months, during which the company has had a total revenue of 1000€ and spent around 200K€. Traffic, return ratio, all numbers are tragic. The founder is looking for VC investors but I think they're all refusing to throw in any money (he's very opaque about everything, so I don't have all the information).</p>

<p>Last month, he fired two people, leaving only him and me in the company, because apparently one of the angel investors that had to do a payment refused to do so. He hired them back two weeks later when another angel investor, that had already a 10% of the company, bought an extra 3% for 90K€. This seems insane to me, because values the company at 3M€. It could also be that the founder is lying to me, it wouldn't surprise me.</p>

<p>So my question is, does it make any sense for me to keep wasting my time and money (I could earn double anywhere else) waiting to get this equity? The company is absolutely unprofitable, but that guy investing extra 90K confuses me and, again, the startup world is in a ridiculous bubble. Have you seen cases where such a failing startup ends up being worth (or at least being bought for) anything? What are the chances of that happening now that investors are more seasoned?</p>

<p>Recently we entered into talks with the competitor to buy the section of their business that sells the equipment, leaving them free to concentrate on training and policy-writing.</p>

<p>Now the (partial) acquisition is going ahead, and we need to send out a letter to the competitor's customers letting them know that from now on, they'll be ordering from us. The letter will be sent from the competitor, and we're working together on writing it.</p>

<p>We've received a draft letter from the competitor, for our feedback:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Dear [customer name]</p>
  
  <p>I am writing to you as a loyal supporting customer and a proficient user of [equipment brand]. Some of you reading this will have had a business association with me for a decade. Others may be more recent, but for however long our association has been, I would like it to continue.</p>
  
  <p>However, over the last twelve months or so, I have been looking for ways that you can perhaps be better served and that I can be left to concentrate on my core strength of providing professional scientific and legally robust advice and training to collectors such as yourself and corporates on their Drug &amp; Alcohol Policy.</p>
  
  <p>[competitor's business name] has had lengthy negotiations with [our business name]. The outcome is that we have agreed to enter into a cooperative arrangement, which, whilst retaining our own corporate entities and identities, is fundamentally a merger of interests. [Our business] is the pre-eminent distributor of drug and alcohol screening products in [country] and will be taking transfer of [competitor's business'] distributorship with [supplier] (the importer of [equipment brand] and associated drug screening product).</p>
  
  <p>We believe that the combined purchasing power of [our business] and [competitor's business] could well lead to economies that will better control the end cost of product to you. Similarly, when new product comes available, through developments, there may be a wider suite of product to choose from.
  Please do not feel that [competitor's business] is abandoning you as this is not the case. We remain in place to render advice on technical, scientific or procedural advice. The only thing changing from a practical standpoint is the product ordering regime.</p>
  
  <p>We continue to promote [equipment brand] as the best professional product currently available for the collection and screening of urine for the purposes of drug detection.</p>
  
  <p>With [competitor's business'] sole distributorship through [supplier] transferring to [our business] we acknowledge that (as currently) you have a choice with whom you deal, but we sincerely believe that the combined strength, depth of knowledge and sheer economies of scale from both companies working in this collaborative partnership will serve you better than before.</p>
  
  <p>Accompanying this email as an attachment is instructions on future ordering from [date of the acquisition].</p>
  
  <p>As stated earlier, we remain available as an advisory and promoter of your endeavours in the drug screening arena. We will continue to promote your business as part of our network of qualified collectors.</p>
  
  <p>It remains for me to collectively thank you for the business we have enjoyed together and hopefully over the next few months I will have the opportunity of thanking each of you individually for the support you have rendered.</p>
  
  <p>Sincerely, [competitor's business owner]</p>

<p>This seems fair in a way that - we all are going to invest equal amount of money and get equal share - plus I will <code>also get salary for running the company</code>.</p>

<p>While the situation is - without the money I won't be able to run the company and it's not too easy to get funding. Also at this point the company is nothing but an idea and proposal.</p>

I'm basically being paid to make intros, outros, and edited videos. But like I said, I already kind of started this business. It's been up for about a month now, and things have been pretty slow. I only had 1 customer throughout the course of one month and it was a relative.</p>

<li>Made a video to market my business.</li>
<li>Made a video on how it works.</li>
<li>Advertised on social media (to multiple audiences).</li>
<li>Search engine optimization.</li>

<p><strong>For this reason, I'm considering contacting an ex-employee of the company on Linkedin.</strong> </p>

<p><strong>But I really want to make sure I don't accidentally do something unethical, or something that would look bad.</strong> I don't want to come across as if I'm trying to be sneaky.</p>

<p>Is what I'm thinking of doing (contacting an ex-employee and ask for general advice), considered unethical or sneaky? Will the company consider it unethical or sneaky?</p>

<p>More generally, where is the line with this kind of thing? Obviously you can't ask about specific confidential pricing information, but can you ask an ex employee e.g. about how his former employer generally negotiates?</p>

"12831","Get technical cofounder or do it yourself?","<p>I am developing a hardware product (solo), and one sub-component involves non-trivial analog/electrical design and signal processing.  I have a BS/MS in the field, and could do the work myself -- so far I have made some prototypes, done some feasibility studies, and come up with a reasonable system architecture.  However, there are still many details to work out.  Ultimately, I didn't get in this to become a technical expert, but rather to solve the problem.</p>

<p>I imagine most engineers would find the problem to be stimulating/interesting.  But practically, given that I only have enough money to support myself and material/prototyping costs, I am not sure how I would go about getting someone else (preferably someone with a PhD or a few years' experience) to work on this full time.  Realistically, I see my options as (a) get funding and hire someone, (b) consider this individual an equal 'cofounder', or (c) suck it up and do the rest (6-8 months) myself.  I live near the university I went to, but I'm not sure if that helps beyond having a wider pool of technical people to choose from.  Also, I am open to moving somewhere else if it helps.</p>

<p>Any advice on how to approach this?  </p>

<p>Up to now, I have been very adamant about minimizing the amount of equity given out and doing most of the work myself.  However, as I get further along, I am getting worn down as I realize all the necessary details to make the product reliable.

"12844","Founder Vesting","<p><strong>TLDR; built an app, business co-founder wants to start a new app right when I just built the MVP, didnt sign equity, no pay, don't know what future steps to make</strong></p>

<p>So I'm a bit dumb in a sense. I'm working on a startup with a business partner and I'm the only developer and he thought of the idea. He was introduced by a friend. </p>

<p>When summer started I didn't feel right to ask for signed equity right away because I didn't know if I could fully build the app. Fast forward a month and a half later I was able to build it. Right when I finish the MVP he said he was interested in another idea he came up with and asked if I was interested in building the app for that. </p>

<p>Essentially my job was to build the app, his was to grab businesses and users. Turns out he thought of the new idea because he thinks it's ""easier to grab users and businesses"" which I'm kind of disappointed at this point because he told me before building the app that lots of businesses he talked to were interested in the first app.</p>

<p>So. I told him I was not interested in creating a new app without launching the first app. He said he wanted to build two apps so he can see which one grows faster -_-. </p>

<p>At this point I just feel kind of jerked around. This isn't my first time trying to start a personal project so I know how hard it is to start a startup, and the possibility of failure. The first idea is good or I wouldn't have joined or worked for free, but it's basically his first time so I think he's just overly optimistic ( he's a good guy ). </p>

<p>He's offering to pay me for the second app to be built, but we haven't signed the equity for the first app. So I was looking into vesting, because at this point his focus is divided between two apps and if one app launches I don't know if he'll just leave. </p>

<p>I don't want to make this too long, but there are two other members (sales and data analyst) who haven't really worked on the startup because obviously the app has to be made before they can fulfill their roles. So overall I basically spent the most time on the startup so far, and I don't know how to make it fair for all of us</p>

"12861","Limits on Total Client Acquisition, Myth or Real?","<p>So I was working on a financial projection tool and stumbled upon a bit of an issue.  I was simulating the percentage chance of getting customers and <strong>the chance of losing them.</strong></p>

<p>Lets say I can predict with great accuracy <strong>I can get 10 customers every month.</strong></p>

<p>If I say at any given time <strong>I will lose 3% of the clients per month on average.</strong>  Then the math concludes that at some point I will lose as many clients as I gain and effectively the <strong>company will stop growing.</strong></p>

<p>For example, lets say I've got 450 clients, 3% of 450 is 13.5.  This number is greater than the 10 customers I could gain every month.  Essentially the company would lose clients down to probably 350 to 400 and stabilize around there never growing anymore.</p>

<p><strong>Is this accurate to think this way in terms of losing a client?</strong> Is it safe to say that given these metrics the company can never grow past 350 to 400~ clients?</p>

<p><strong>If yes, then is the only solution to escape that customer lock to get more then 10 customers every month, correct?</strong></p>

"12922","Royalty rates when you need multiple licenses","<p>I plan to manufacture and sell a hardware product that has elements which are patent-protected by more than one third party.  When determining royalty rates for each party, does the fact that I will be paying to more than one party affect the rate I am expected to pay to each?  Or will each party charge a similar rate regardless of how many other licenses are necessary to manufacture/sell the product?</p>

<p>I will be negotiating 1-2 licensing agreements in the near future, but my concern is that further down the line I may discover I am infringing on something else, and the total royalty rate will be beyond the threshold for which I am willing to continue the business.  Is it reasonable to request from the licensors that they reduce their rate if necessary such that the total rate does not exceed some amount?</p>

"12923","How do royalty rates translate to equity?","<p>I am negotiating a royalty rate for an IP license, and I want to verify my understanding of how a royalty percentage of revenue translates into effective ownership/equity of the business (non-voting, of course).</p>

<p>Let's assume the royalty percentage 'x' applies to the retail price of the product (though it often will apply to 'net sales' instead).  So if the product is on the shelf for $100, and x is 3%, then the royalty fee is $3.</p>

<p>Let's also assume that all company revenue is affected by the royalty rate, and that the profit margin 'y' of the company before royalty payments is 25% (may be as low as 10-15% for more established products).  Then, it seems that the effective 'value ownership' of the company is x/y, since company value is only based on future cash flows.  This would imply that the licensor would own 12% or 20% of the company with a 3% or 5% royalty rate, respectively.</p>

<p>For standard profit margin and royalty rates, this seems like a very high number given that the licensor is not actively operating the business or taking any major financial/time risk.  Am I missing something here?</p>

  <p>Organizations will have additional direct costs associated with

  organizations {1} <strong>must provide a readily available independent recourse
  mechanism</strong> to hear individual complaints at no cost to the individual.
  Providers of such services set their own fees.  Furthermore, the

And founded interested investors here on South America, the problem is i tend to see social media platforms as US based in order to be successful; I kind of think that we should convince our investors to move us to the US and look up for other potential investors there (so its very high risk), but one of my partners (co founder) thinks we should launch here (with operations based in our country), so we get into this argument where i think whenever the platform is released, we will be against the clock before some US based copy is launched and we got dumped right away, while he thinks with a good marketing plan we could reach US users without a problem and is not needed for us to risk so much.</p>

<p>So as you can see i am in a dilemma, i also think renting US servers without being able to be physically close to them it's a huge pain in the ass, we expect high traffic and South American servers don't convince me at all... Maybe i am overthinking, but i see the US as the land to be the successful by the reach you can pull in there. But at the same time i am thinking investors could be scared off with such high risk. More than anything its my idea of a US based clone that will take us of the market.</p>

"13063","Why would a website startup need funding?","<p>I have a decent startup idea on web and for smartphones, but no experience on entrepreneurship except what I read online. So, I had been looking up for the choices people made to build successful websites. I realize almost all great websites have a significant funding in exchange for a great deal of shares which proved to be extremely valuable today. Therefore I can tell funding is a must, only that I don't really know what I would need it for (or what facebook needed it for, for example). I really thought about it, and still have no idea. </p>

<p>Only answers I could think of were:</p>

<ul>
<li>Development costs</li>
<li>Hosting costs</li>
<li>Marketing costs</li>
</ul>

<p>I am a developer myself and I think I can set up everything technical in a year. I am already hosting online for free to test, but I plan to set up my own servers to meet increasing demand. This hardware should cost something significant for me, but nothing I can't save in a year. I am willing to meet this expense myself because if I really need to pay hardware to host my website it means I am already successful. And for marketing costs, I have friends who are extremely active worldwide. We already came up with some interesting ideas which would cost very little but may reach to many of my target audience. Another thing is if my hosting expenses increase with the number of users or if I need technical help to add new features quickly, initial earnings from advertisements could be spent to those expenses along with my own small contributions.</p>

<p>Given the situation I am in, I still think there must be a reason all successful websites needed investment. Am I underestimating any of those steps, being unrealistic about development, hosting or marketing? Or am I completely ignoring another significant cost? (for example I never truly looked into legal costs if there is any)</p>

<p>I would greatly appreciate if someone with experience/knowledge about this topic can give me their opinion on funding as I really do not want to go blindly into this project. </p>

"13083","How and Why do Universities Take the IP and License Startups?","<p>I've been designing and developing a startup for many years. Now I am a Ph.D. student and trying to commercialize the service I've been developing. Because of being a university employee (Ph.D. Student), the university owns the IP and licenses it to me.</p>

<p>First of all, they argue that because the courses I've taken and the projects I've worked on at the university have taught me how to improve the design of the startup that I've been developing many years before entering the graduate school, the university should own the IP. I don't understand their argument. When other Ph.D. students acquire the same knowledge and work for Google or Microsoft after graduation, the university does not argue that they should share their salary with the university, but just because I've been smart enough to develop my own business, then I have to share my revenue with the university???</p>

<p>My second question is about the way they license it. What are the common licensing models? What are the best practices to work with them? What happens if after a couple of years the university decides to sell the IP to someone else instead of renewing the license with me?</p>

<p>My third question is about the way they share the equity. They do not have any reasonable metric for this purpose. There is an individual in the Tech Transfer office who evaluates the lines of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, or backend of the website you have developed while being a student, and determines their share. How can I convince him that this code is the result of many years of hard work on the design and development of the idea, business model, revenue model, ... before being a student?</p>

"13087","Should I scale and how to split the shares of my company","<p>I have a specific composition of technical skills (BigData + ML + Cloud) and know how to deliver good quality product and I've created one, let's call it MagicBox. It took me a year of hard work to get to the point where the product is now. During the production I've established a company to organize it in a legal way (taxes).</p>

<p>I have two corporate clients (they've found me themselves) which are paying for using MagicBox and there are more companies interested in testing. In general it earns enough for me to get decent salary and pay at least one more dev. I can get ~5 more clients without to much hassle.</p>

<p>There is a competitor on the market with >$10M of funding and established reputation. My product outperforms theirs in tests (tests made by a client). The technology is not trivial to copy.</p>

<p>I'm a hacker by heart and do not like to spend time on paperwork, business and marketing stuff. The money is no motivation for me.</p>

<p>I'm considering if I should:</p>

<ul>
<li>keep it as it is, cut of the tickets, find some other product to work on,</li>
<li>enhance product, find 1-2 more clients, have fun without trying too hard,</li>
<li>go global and scale, experience gained from cooperation with one client seems to be really unique. They're in a regulated field with a lot of many weird quirks.</li>
</ul>

<p>My default was option no. 2, but I met few crazy people and they think it's a huge chance to do a cool business, support community and make the world around us a bit better. One of the people I've bounced the idea/product expressed interest in cooperation and taking the business to the next level. He has more business experience, a network of contacts (with all genre of people), feels comfortable doing all the business related work.  We know each other for long, have similar work ethics, we also shared some failures - in other words, we trust each other. </p>

"13101","Cofounder being cut out of equity split - what should I do?","<p>I recently decided to step down from a position in a startup in which I was declared a co-founder (even though I came on later than 3 partners). There was a hostile environment being created in which the CEO continued to criticize me, in some cases in front of other partners and former partners. </p>

<p>After increasing the customer base by 10X, he was frustrated that it was taking too long to increase another 10X. At the same time, every time I launched an ad campaign I'd get emergency texts or calls saying to take down the campaign because it was exceeding our capacity (i.e. too many takers). I was consistently pointing out key issues that were either limiting our growth or liabilities in our business model. </p>

<p>The company had been setup with the ""Slicing the Pie"" equity distribution model, and after hundreds and hundreds of hours contributed, I had approx. 12% equity built up. </p>

<p>After a particularly egregious email from the CEO, I announced that I'd be stepping down. I met with the CEO who seemed perfectly happy with my departure and we made an agreement that I would be a silent partner going forward. My equity would not be touched, it would simply dilute as my contributions halted going forward. I would however have an equal vote on all decisions impacting my equity (taking on capital, selling, changing structure, etc).</p></p>

<p>A couple of weeks later, I lost access to company accounts that I'd been told I'd be able to keep. I reached out and after many, many attempts, the CEO apologized and said it wouldn't happen again. A couple of weeks later, I noticed that I was unable to access the file tracking our equity split. Again, after many, many attempts, I finally got an email saying that the group voted to vacate my equity entirely.</p>

<p>The argument is that I left without good reason and my time was therefor valued at zero. Now, the company is currently not profitable. But when/if they do become profitable, I believe that my (diluted) stake should be recognized.</p>

<p>After a conversation with the partners, it is clear that they have no intention of honoring our agreement (which they do not deny exists but was not on paper). There is no exit clause one way or another in our partnership agreement. There is significant documentation about my hourly contributions on a weekly basis.</p>

<p>The questions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Recognizing that there's no current value to the stake, what can I do
to fight back? Obviously, hiring an attorney would be more costly than it might be worth. </li>
<li>Acknowledging that someone is going to say ""just move on,"" what are my legal obligations when communicating about the business itself. If I have no financial stake in the company, can I publicly attack them?</li>

<p>We are a relatively new (i.e. not well known) IT and accounting firm. We have developed an accounting software and related software like CRM for a particular country's Small Businesses. We developed this system to cater for our clients.</p>

<p><strong>Competition</strong></p>

<p>The market already has some big name listed players servicing the target market. </p>

<p><strong>Competitive Advantage</strong></p>

<p>The difference between our system and all others in the market are:
1. We can customize the system to suit clients needs. This is not about customization via front-end. What we can offer is customization using custom software development.
2. Since we are accountants as well, we can drive business process efficiency to our clients using our software and custom software development than anyone else.
3. The clients will deal with the same contact for their accounting and IT issues.</p>

<p><strong>Goal</strong></p>

<p>To increase the customer base (either/or accounting and Software development) and therefore increase the sales and profit of the company.</p>

<p><strong>Issue</strong></p>

<p>How do we introduce this product/service to the market?</p>

<p><strong>Potential Solutions</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>We could offer free software licences (or introductory offers) to new accounting clients to increase publicity. Not sure if it will decrease the perceived quality of the solution.</li>
<li>Sell the software licence at a premium, bundling the accounting services with the software. We might miss out on clients who haven't been sold on the idea.</li>
<li>Offer desktop software in addition to the cloud version. This will delay the release by around 1-2 months, but might be worth it if the clients don't want to move to cloud.</li>
<li>Offer free accounting services/software to all referral parties.</li>
<li>Work with a bank (or another service provider who targets the market with a non-competitive product/service) to tie the software to their products and use their marketing power to expand. We haven’t approached anyone yet and not sure if the banks would be willing to work with someone unknown. Also need to explore if this is ethical professionally.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Question</strong></p>

<p>Which of these options will get the desired results quicker? Or Is there a better way to approach this?</p>

"13136","Being kicked out from the startup by my cofounders: how to deal with it?","<p>I have cofounded a startup several years ago and valued it above anything else. I tend to get really passionate about things I love. All my life was inside this startup. I put more energy and effort than the CEO. But then we ran out of money, and the problems began. We discovered fundamental differences in our mindsets, values, and goals. I got kicked out from the team. </p>

<p>This is when I discovered that this startup was an essential part of my identity. When networking, I was presenting myself as ""<code>&lt;name&gt;</code> from <code>&lt;company X&gt;</code>, we are working on <code>&lt;project Y&gt;</code>"". I felt like I was on a mission.</p>

<p>Now, I have to rewrite my personal branding, and I struggle with it. I am still attached to the old project. Even now, I tend to talk to everyone about this startup. </p>

<p>Just out of passion, I started doing small tasks for them again, for low pay, as a freelancer (not a core team member). That's because I didn't want to give up on this project.</p>

<p>But I am not delusional and I understand that I have to find my own life.</p>

"13140","Joining a Start-up on percentage sharing","<p>This is more of a finance related question. I'm invited to join a startup that has already developed a product and currently have managed to make a bit of money from a couple of clients. They've already spent time and money into its development. However they wish to avail my expertise, time and knowledge as well as future investments and have offered a partnership into the company in hope that we will collectively be able to grow the product into a much bigger platform. </p>

<p>We're currently unsure of how this will work. Say they have invested $100k already. Their incomings from it are $5k monthly. We can somewhat determine its current value. However we are aiming to make $30k monthly (theoretically) with our collective input eventually. With this calculation, their initial investment will break even after 3.5 months roughly. The product will continue to develop and we will both be expected to play our equal part. </p>

<p>What percentage split should we be looking at? Currently they have offered me 30% share (no initial financial investment in terms of buying any of these shares, but instead sharing of all immediate and future expenses equally). If we are putting in equal (50% each) efforts, money and time moving forward, and the incomings result in covering all initial costs and investments involved after a few months, would it be fair to stick to a lesser share forever? Should we be looking at a revision of this share in 6 months if I agree to it now? Obviously this is all in the air, we may not meet our targets, but in the event we do, is it fair to say the two partners are now equal shareholders and the split should be 50/50?</p>

I have the opportunity to make the purchase with an excellent cash back credit card in the businesses name, and I have a personal credit card in my name with an excellent balance transfer program.

Plus, I have a hard time make a decent living and pay my bills, yet, I'm living in a poor country.</p>

<p>My dream is to be a successful founder, so long story short, I've done some research about AI and machine learning and I strongly believe that is the future of CS. I've been working on this project for about 2 months, first as part-time, then full-time, for now I have a fully functional proof-of-concept/mvp that apply sentiment analysis on both news headlines and tweets to help traders and investors evaluate topic's sentiment and monitor changes over time, and also it help to collect data that are so large and complex because it can no longer be processed adequately by traditional methods (I assume that is technically painful).</p>

<p>My problem is that I only have a high school degree and my college years was a succession of shameful failures (I studied Physical chemistry and then switched to Public law but never graduated) so actually, I'm pretty sure that any investor / incubator will not take me seriously.</p>

<p>The app was built using Python (in 2 months with no prior experience) and multiple APIs so the truth is that I didn't built any NLP algorithm or done some advanced classification / regression but the app solve a problem.

"13193","Selling service to your own employer?","<p>1.5 years ago I started to work on my own project. Statistically, chances are better if you are in the heart of the industry, so I accepted an offer from one mid-sized startup (~ 1B private company) and moved to the the bay area (USA). Before moving to the US I did somewhat related work for a year as a contractor for a highly successful startup in Europe (this startup was valued around 200M in 3-4 years). Overall my professional experience is around 15 years in telecom/c++.</p>

<p>Once I described my personal project to the company owner/CEO and he asked me if I could do something similar to our company where I work as the company appears to be a heavy user of very similar services. I asked how much we spend on that and if I can know details and who to speak to and I was told that I can ask details from certain VPs (company spends over $200K/month, this number approximately doubles each year). It was obviously informal chat and this isn't exactly the same as my startup project that I'm working on, though it's closely related. I said I'll see if I can apply my ideas.</p>

<p>Since that day I refocused my idea to better suit the company that I work for. I increased pace of my own project: I hired two people to help me with side projects (like dashboard website with stats etc), basically right after finishing a day at the office I go home and work a few hours on my own project + weekends.</p>

<p>The company uses top 5 providers simultaneously in <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing#Infrastructure_as_a_service_.28IaaS.29"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">IAAS</a> field and now I'm looking for a way to join and become 6th provider. I identified a use case that wouldn't require big changes and would instantly provide measurable product improvement. While working on this project I also identified and developed custom solutions that will cut the total monthly bill at least by half (e.g. over 100K/month). These ideas not only save money, they should also make product much better overall and these improvements might actually be more important that the monetary savings. When fully implemented my solution would become more PAAS than IAAS. </p>

<p>One-person companies have no chance to become service providers of this company for way less important/critical services and I know about cases where such companies were reject for simply being too small.
My selling points are:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Technical excellence. I work for this company for almost a year. Not only I delivered what I was assigned, I did side projects on my own that boosted overall productivity of developers and CEO personally thanked me for doing that (I was actually surprised that he was aware that I was doing that side project).</p></li>
<li><p>In that startup in Europe I was doing pilots with high-risk clients. Basically, I was doing exactly what I want to do now: launch a pilot with a customer that's not sure, but no matter what there must not be any service disruption.</p></li>
<li><p>I'm insider to the company (which might as well be an obstacle because of possible conflict of interests). To make it clear, as an employee I do totally different unrelated stuff at the company (C++ and 3D graphics, while my personal project is about networking and servers).</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Points for rejecting my startup service company:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Potential conflict of interests as already mentioned.</p></li>
<li><p>If the service is launched they might be concerned that I'll stop working for them as an employee and will be working instead on my startup to provide them with that service.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>I'll have a one on one meeting with a decision maker at the company and I'll try to present my ideas and discuss possibility to launch a pilot. I know that guy is very good technically but I don't know him personally (unlike CEO, but I decided not to go to CEO directly, even though if I were in his shoes I'd flip from such findings and potential benefits). However, these improvements (that save 100K/month) are double without my service that I'm building with intention to provide to them. If I fully describe what exactly I did they will be able to implement that on their own.</p>

<p>So, any pointers where my proposition might be weak? Any suggestions on how to approach that kind of conversation? What kind of answers should I be prepared to give?</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> I had a conversation with CPO and my ideas/plans were well-received. They are ok if I do a pilot project and it's clear from the start that I do that as an independent service provider (and if I can do better then existing ones then they will buy from me instead).</p>

"13201","What to do when management doesn't agree with you being CTO and they offer you to be VP of Engineering because you don't manage enough?","<p><strong>Problem</strong></p>

<p>More than a week ago on our Monday meetings a discussion was started in which my colleagues co-founders (there are 3 of them) said that I'm not fitting in CTO position because I don't manage people enough. They said it's vital for CTO to manage people and that I should pass the title to one of them who is less experienced in technical domain but is currently working closely with our developer (yes, we have currently 1 developer) and people in company usually ask him technical questions since he is on place more time than me / show up earlier. The concern about the titles was risen because in few weeks there will be about 5 new people in our company and they should know who is who.</p>

<p><strong>How I felt</strong></p>

<p>I was demotivated and sad that they thought I'm not the right person for the job since I didn't share that opinion. I found it offensive. All of it resulted in too much emotions so I asked for postponing this decision/discussion for the next meeting so I could calm down and think it over. They agreed.</p>

<p><strong>Second meeting</strong></p>

<p>On the next meeting we were discussing for about 1.5h why they think that I shouldn't be the CTO and why I think that I should. We even googled what CTO means and what are his responsibilities but I think that after that long talk everybody was a bit tired and they just saw what they wanted to see since there are websites where CTO's meaning is very vaguely written. I asked what title should I have if not CTO. They offered me to be VP of Engineering instead. I managed to postpone the decision a few days later despite some objection. One of them even said that there are no arguments that would change his decision and that it's waste of time.</p>

<p><strong>After</strong></p>

<p>Now, when I can google calmly I see clearly that my colleagues terribly confused these two titles since from the articles I read (<a href=""https://bothsidesofthetable.com/want-to-know-the-difference-between-a-cto-and-a-vp-engineering-4fc3750c596b"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">1</a>, <a href=""https://medium.com/engineering-leadership/defining-roles-cto-and-or-vp-engineering-f1c7563643a3"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">2</a>, <a href=""https://www.ivyexec.com/executive-insights/2015/cto-versus-vp-engineering-whats-the-difference/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">3</a>) it appears that the VP of Engineering is the man for managing people rather than CTO and that I fit perfectly for the CTO role.</p>

<p><strong>Question</strong></p>

<p>I'm not sure what should I do. Should I send them the articles now? Should I send them to everyone or just to one person (eg. CEO)?  Should I wait till the next meeting? Or maybe I should just take the VP of Engineering title?</p>

<p>I generally never cared about the titles and I can take that VP of Engineering title just for the sake of peace but now that I'm sure the meaning of these two it would just feel awkward and confusing for the people who actually know what it means.</p>

<p>I've been thinking of starting some web related business instead. Like selling (drop shipping with FBA) products in a niche to consumers. It seems interesting, but my long IT experience and passion for things like PowerShell automation etc. makes me torn. I'd like to do both, but my time is too limited and if I do that then both businesses will suffer. Now, I'm really just looking for advice from anyone who has been doing the same (starting up a company on the side by way of bootstrapping) and have some advice to offer about strategies.</p>

<p>Also, I'm an introvert, so cold calling and sales really frustrate me. I like inbound marketing a lot better, but it seems harder with B2B than B2C.</p>

"13209","Should Total Available Market figures factor in product ranges such as 'Cars' or be limited to specific styles such as 'Sports Cars' & 'Family Cars'?","<p>I am working on the 'Market Research' section, of a new Business Plan, where my current focus lies on 'Market Segmentation'. </p>

<p>I want to establish my Total Available Market (TAM), Serviceable Available Market (SAM) and Serviceable Obtainable Market (SOM) figures.  I understand the following:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>TAM:</strong>  Total Market Demand for product across the World.</li>
<li><strong>SAM:</strong>  A segment of the TAM, targeted by products, within Geographical area.</li>
<li><strong>SOM:</strong>  Portion of the SAM, that can be captured.</li>
</ul>

<p>Where I am getting a little stuck, lies within the TAM.  </p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>

<p>Say I was a Car Manufacturer, whom focused on creating Sports Cars.  Would my TAM factor in the entire global market for Cars, where the SAM would then provide further segmentation tailored for Sports Cars, or would my TAM only consider Sports Cars across the Globe?    </p>

<p>As a side question, is the SAM segmented solely within a Geographical area or can other Segmentation be used; such as Psychographics and Demographics?</p>

"13224","Why doesn't my partner want to split 10k equally ($3333 between 3), but would rather put aside an extra $2500?","<p>So, three people did a web application together for a client, each as an individual contractor. We are not in an LLC together, nor did we interact at any point with this client as an LLC - always as contractors. Total payment for the project was 10k. We agree before the project to split the profits equally (each getting a third of the profits).</p>

<p>My thought was to have our client write 3 separate checks for $3333, giving each of us our cut. That seemed the easiest and most straight-forward.</p>

<p>But, one partner doesn't want that. He had the client write a check to him directly for the complete $10,000. He wants to give me $2500, another guy $2500, and but keep $5000 in his account; out of the $5000, he will pay himself $2500, but keep the rest in there to help pay for taxes (so $2500 for him, $2500 for taxes). Specially, he is worried that he will be taxed more than us because he was paid 10K, instead of $3333. He also said he had the client cut him 1 check for 10k instead of 3 checks for $3333 because it was easier for their accountant. </p>

<p>He says that once he pays himself $2500, and pays any extra taxes due to the fact he was paid 10k vs our $3333, he will take whatever is left and split that with us come April. </p>

<p>We still have to pay taxes on our $2500 and any money ""left over"" from the $2500 he put aside that might come in April. </p>

<p>This seemed really confusing to me. I said to him the best way is to just split the money $3333 each and we pay our own taxes. Plus we all get our money now and me and the other guy don't need to be taxed twice.</p>

<p>Am I missing something though? He is always saying how he is talking to his accountant about this. Is there any angle I'm missing? Can he save us more money his way or is a $3333 equal split just better?</p>

We worked together, but as three separate contractors/freelancers. We are not in an LLC together. The total profit was $10,000 and we agree to split it 3 equal ways: $3333.33.</p>

<p>One of the contractors (let's call him contractor ""B"") knows the Client personally, and so had the Client write him one check for the total 10,000 amount. The client wrote the check in contractor ""B""'s name.</p>

<p>Contractor ""B"" communicated to us that he does not want to get taxed on $10,000 (just $3333.33), so needs to prove that he wrote checks to us ($3333.33 x 2) and that we were paid. Contractor ""B"" told us he ""needs our home address and social security number to file 1099's"" to prove that we got paid by him.</p>

<p>Does Contractor ""B"" really need our social security number and address to prove he paid us? He is not an LLC or business himself, but just another contractor like us; he would be writing it from his personal account.</p>

"13244","How did Kanoa fail at delivering Minimum Viable Products (MVP)?","<p>Summary/ TL;DR: <strong>How does one do/don't for MVPs and the context of the case study that I'm interested in is Kanoa's recent shut down</strong> (for the sake of making things concrete).</p>

<p>I was reading the lean startup and it mentioned how important it is to get the real users use your product to test if the idea itself is something people want. I am interested in understanding effective ways to actually do a MVP and ways to definitively NOT do it. I choose the Kanoa headphones example because I feel a good way to study this is with a case study and because I found this video that actually <a href=""https://youtu.be/36Gw3tErUSM?t=22m21s"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">made their entire company shut down</a>. I guess what I am curious is how exactly does one get one's product out there and do a MVP without having their company receive irreparable damage like Kanoa did. Is the issue with this specific case study that:</p>

<ol>
<li>They tried to get their product review which makes a real product and not a minimum viable product?</li>
<li>They lied to their reviewer and tried to essentially bribe the reviewer (which is obviously a no no always)</li>
</ol>

<p>but besides point 2 which should always be obvious, how does one actually gain customers that want to try a unfinished product or an MVP? Are there any principled ways or standard resources people use to get their MVP out their without their company suffering a huge loss? Was the main issue with Kanoa was that they raised capital from real customers without actually delivering them any type of product? From the lean start up it seems to me that customers are suppose to pay for the MVP, so how is what Kanoa did different? Is it that they didn't actually deliver them anything, not even a MVP? Would the right choice is to stay in investor capital mode until the product is ready to be deliveried? Or how does one actually get MVPs out their without damaging one's reputation as a company?</p>

<p>And looking at other comparable tools. 
If an investor puts in $10,000 and they get a 20% discount, I would expect that their $10,000 to be valued at $10,000 * 1.2, or $12,000, but all the examples I see show that the investor would convert at $12,500 and I can't seem to figure out why?</p>

databases, but it's all kinda couch expertise, cause i've never had

could later become more of Full Stack Developer, or even switch to back end
entirely. </li>
<li>I need technology so that i can hit the market with my MVP
as soon as in couple of month. Taking into account that i'll be
working alone on whole back end thing maybe with a couple of people

<p>Both accounts have a different number of likes, but there is quite a discrepancy between these figures, and we would like to merge both accounts in the future. A combined account is easier to manage and has the option for ""Paid Promotion."". We also think that we would be more coherent. But a question popped out while discussing it. The question was... why shouldn't we keep both accounts? Obviously, it would be easier for us to have a single account, but now it's kind of a tricky situation because of the number of followers (and hopefully clients one day).</p>

"13428","Structuring a partnership agreement for a gym startup","<p>I am a 30 year old fitness trainer. I have worked in 5 gyms in the last ten years and I would consider myself a technically strong trainer. Offlate a very close friend of mine proposed that we should start a gym together and that he would fund the entire capital required. These were his terms -</p>

<ul>
<li>Let's say the capital amount is 10,000$ </li>
<li>He is receiving an unsecured loan with a high-interest rate of 20% per annum. </li>
<li>He expects us to start repaying the loan in 6 months, on a monthly basis. So say, 2000$ is the interest, it would be 167$ in interest plus say, 500$ of the principal. This payment would be counted as operating cost. </li>
<li>Other operating costs would involve paying other trainers, utility bills, taxes, and equipment maintenance. </li>
<li>He proposes 50% share in monthly profits after we take care of all the operating costs. So let's say the gym makes 2000$ this month, 1000$ is operating expenses, then I would make 500$. </li>
<li>He expects me to <strong>not</strong> include my salary as part of operating costs. </li>
</ul>

<p>I see many problems with this deal - </p>

<ul>
<li>My friend is a passive investor in this deal. He is only going to invest money.</li>
<li>As an investor, he is expecting the return on his investment too quick (6 months).</li>
<li>If the gym doesn't do well or barely makes even, then I do not make any money for the time I spent as a trainer/manager/marketing person. I have a family to feed.</li>
<li>My friend says I am a 50% partner in liability too. So, say the gym doesn't do well, we have to sell of the equipment and whatever loan amount remains,  I would have to split the repayment of it.</li>
<li>I would be the only owner taking the bottom line for function and growth of this gym. I have strong pubic relationship in my area and I am a trained professional. </li>
<li>I intend to build this gym as a brand - If the gym does very well and If I have to expand in two years, I can potentially secure a bank loan at lower interest rate, but I would have a 50% partner who essentially brings nothing to the table and has to be tagged along just because he invested 50% in the first gym and is a part owner of the brand. </li>
</ul>

<p>Now, I have no money of my own to invest in a brand new gym. I will not receive a bank loan because I have nothing to plead as collateral. So, an investor who believes in my skills, professionalism, honesty, and integrity is my only way to realizing my dream of building my own gym. </p>

<p>So, here are my questions (I am novice in business management and this is my first business deal) -</p>

<ul>
<li>How bad is the deal that my friend is structuring? </li>
<li>Is it not financially/legally incorrect to split profits whenever the gym makes a profit? Wouldn't it make more financial sense to re-invest the profits the gym makes back into the gym? Or invest it in other market-linked investments?</li>
<li>Typically, if an angel investor funds your company, do you give up so much equity? especially, when the investor is nothing bringing anything to the table other than money. </li>
<li>Isn't my friend short-sighted in his expectation of ROI? </li>
<li>Let's say a bank did fund my business, I would be a 100% owner and I wouldn't have to give up any equity. But when my friend funds the business, I have to pay his ROI plus he has access to the entire profit the gym is making and take out the money from the gym whenever he wants.</li>
</ul>

<p>I am thinking about structuring the deal this way: </p>

<ul>
<li>I will be taking a salary as part of operating costs, which will be reviewed every 6 months depending on gym growth. My friend will receive ROI starting in 6 months on a monthly basis.</li>
<li>The profit the gym makes will be reinvested in the gym / other investments.</li>
<li>My friend should be happy that for the funding he is doing today, he is going to make a 20% return starting in 6 months and has 50% stake in a future gym chain. </li>
<li>I plan to include a buy-sell agreement which would set conditions for him to sell out his equity to me, should he decide to move on after he receives full ROI on his money. </li>
</ul>

<p>Do you see an issue with the way I am structuring the deal?</p>

<p>Sadly, that doesn't work because some men just want to watch the whole world burn. So I got the idea that I should offer this app to departments that are using a waiting room system, for a small compensation, and have them update the counters themselves. Problem is, I don't know how these waiting room systems work. They probably have an internal counter and the servicepeople just press a button to increment the last value. Internal, meaning it's not online.</p>

<p>That creates a problem for me, since I can't have that number pop up in my database without some interface. I am thinking of approaching the company that manufactures these devices first, and offer a deal. But then I ask myself if they have programmers that can develop the system on their own and decline my offer. The thought of that is really disconcerning because my dad came up with this idea and I programmed it; it would really suck if someone took it and made it their own.</p>

<p>So how do I approach this problem? Is there a precedent from which I can learn how to monetize my app?</p>

<p>P.S. I should add that these waiting room ticket machines are definitely not some high-tech gadgets. They use 7-segment displays and a scoreboard style for tracking the last 3 updated counters. Maybe I should come up with an upgrade that would make use of LCDs and touchscreens?</p>

"13591","Reasons *not* to accept prepaid cards on your store","<p>I am evaluating a prepaid card issuance project. This will be a VISA or MasterCard prepaid card. Among the things I need to estimate are the merchants this card will be able to work on.</p>

<p>The <a href=""https://www.consumerfinance.gov/ask-cfpb/what-is-the-difference-between-a-prepaid-card-a-credit-card-and-a-debit-card-en-433/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">differences between prepaid, debit and credit cards</a> are pretty obvious from the <em>user's</em> point of view. As an user, there are <a href=""https://www.securitybank.com/blog/credit-card-vs-debit-card-vs-prepaid-card-use/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">pros and cons</a> for each one. Now, from the <em>merchant's</em> point of view: are there reasons to chose credit/debit over prepaid?</p>

<p>By accepting card payments, and not cash only, merchants expect either to sell more or to reach customers that wouldn't be available otherwise (think e-commerces, where cash is usually not an option.) Would there be reasons to accept credit cards, but to prevent users from paying with prepaid cards?</p>

<p>I've found the following reasons to reject prepaid cards, but I wonder if there are more:</p>

<ol>
<li>To avoid granting free access to <a href=""https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/505"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">paid-membership-only</a> privilleges,</li>
<li>To <a href=""https://forum.foxycart.com/discussion/9220/prevent-pre-paid-visa-cards-with-stripe"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">prevent fraud or theft when renting</a> expensive stuff,</li>
<li>If you have a <a href=""https://www.paypal-community.com/t5/Bank-accounts-and-credit-cards/Using-a-prepaid-debit-or-credit-card/td-p/352496"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">validation process to prevent fraud</a> but it wouldn't work out with this type of card</li>
<li>In the U.S., restaurants have a tendency to charge the tip when the user has left the store. Given that this extra charge can be declined if the card has not enough balance, <a href=""https://bucks.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/05/31/will-more-restaurants-ban-the-use-of-prepaid-cards/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">some restaurants don't accept prepaid cards</a>.</li>

<p>Are there any other differences? Do you know of certain transactions or operations that do not work with a prepaid card? Are there industries or merchant categories where accepting prepaid cards is a bad idea or unfeasible?</p>

<li>We will be able to convert 2 succesful matches per month (with 1 recruiter).</li>

"13678","LLC Filing: are my registered agents also required to manage (be members of) the LLC?","<p>I'm filing for an LLC in Florida (parents live there) for monetary savings (e.g., $200 to file in NYC, $125 to file in Florida), but I'm based out of NYC. I just submitted the <code>Articles of Organization</code> (located <a href=""http://dos.myflorida.com/sunbiz/forms/limited-liability-company/#flllcforms"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a>, then go to <strong>Florida LLC Forms</strong>), but think I made a mistake.</p>

<p>Basically, to file in Florida, I needed to add them as a <code>Registered Agent</code> and their address. Lower on the form it asks for <code>Name And Address of Person(s) Authorized to Manage LLC</code>. Given that they're listed as a <code>Registered Agent</code>, I assumed they would also be <code>Authorized Persons</code>. I've listed all three of us as <code>AMBR</code> (<code>Authorized Member: authorized to execute and file records with this office</code>).</p>

<p>Now as I'm filling out the <code>Operating Agreement</code>, the Florida Filing website suggests a <code>Multi-member Organization</code>, and asking for % interest per member.</p>

<p><strong>Question</strong>: I'm wondering if putting their names (parents) as <code>Authorized Persons</code> was unnecessary (not needed for them being <code>Registered Agents</code>) and adds liability to them as well as me. I should be the only member with any sort of liability, and they should only be agents based in Florida. Is that the case?</p>

<hr>

<p>Side note: I think it's okay if I file outside the state I live in, as <a href=""https://www.legalzoom.com/articles/starting-up-which-state-to-file-your-llc-in"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this article</a> states:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>However, it's important to consider the fees and state income taxes
  your business may be required to pay if you file in your home state.
  For that reason, if your business has no physical facility or
  storefront—a consulting business, for example—or if you plan on
  conducting the majority of your business out of state, you should
  consider starting an LLC in a state other than your home state.</p>

"13684","Balancing shareholder contributions in different currencies","<p>Not sure if this question would go here or Money SE, but after reviewing the rules I think it belongs here.</p>

<p>I am currently facing a situation with a startup parent company to two entities; one based in the US and another based in another country. We are collecting our first round of shareholders contributions, and the shareholders are the same for both entities. </p>

<p>My question is regarding the currency in which to accept the contributions for each entity. Currently, in the other country, there is a large discrepancy between the official exchange rate and the black market exchange rate. Naturally, many of the shareholders from the US want to contribute in the other currency; however, I am trying to convince them to perhaps use USD as it is more stable. This is a problematic request, as we have shareholders in the other country as well, and they would almost certainly use their currency rather than the USD.</p>

<p>How should we decide to collect the contributions? What exchange rate should we use to prevent arbitrage and make things fair? Is there a middle ground here or should we consider an out of the box solution?</p>

<p>Please recommend a way to proceed to try and appease everyone.</p>

I have developed 25+ small android applications in the past (ranging from lots of small applications to a few larger ones) and I am certain that I can do a good job, but am not certain how much to charge as this is my first project for a client. I will not be doing 'mates rates' as I have been down that path in another career and it is not a good idea, but want to be fair! My friend has already used my existing applications and understands the quality of my work is high.</p>

<p>The application will be subscription based for users, and in a nut-shell, allow them to input and analyse lots of raw data, in order to chart progression and aid improvement. The data will be held in a relational database on a remote server.</p>

<p>The basic idea is that user will be able to see a detailed, easy to understand, and visual representation of the change in various aspects of the inputted data over time. It will be quite a complex time consuming task to organise and analysing various aspects of the data that the user puts in. (I can not say much more as I have signed a non disclosure!)</p>

<p>I will be coding the application as well as designing and creating the UI.</p>

<p>With my given experience, how much would be fair to charge? I can imagine the project taking several months for me to complete.</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

Overall, there isn't a very clear model and systematic operating procedure to help all sales in the department to succeed.</p>

<p>I've done some research online to see how does a successful sales team operate that's selling to the large enterprise in a business to business environment for software and design industry.</p>

<p>I came across many examples of having Account Executive (AE) and Sales Development Representative (SDR) working together closely. Ultimately, AE is the closer, and SDR is the lead generator.</p>

<p>I tried to implement this system in our department and it seems to be having a lot of problems. Here's a list of problems I am encountering and looking for people who know what's going on to give me a hint or show me the right path.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>SDR is doing all the hard work by cold calling while AE is just there to harvest. So if SDR is not doing well, AE got no one to sell to.</p></li>
<li><p>SDR doesn't get as high pay as AE but get some commission for any qualified meetings. However, this is still showing problems because SDR feels they are working under AE and they see themselves as a telemarketer only. Thus, the turn over rate for this position becomes relatively high.</p></li>
<li><p>When SDR book a meeting, it is hard to hand off to AE. As a customer, who agreed to a meeting, probably prefer to talk to SDR and that's why they accepted the meeting. So when a customer is passed to AE from SDR, AE really have to rebuild the connection where SDR is already a step closer. This really causes the customer has a way to not give AE any time to explain about our product.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>I attempted several times to have AE, SDR working together. However, it doesn't seem to work.</p>
