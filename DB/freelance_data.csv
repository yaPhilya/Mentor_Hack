9,"I'm considering starting a business in the state of Rhode Island in the USA. I've begun to do the research on options available to me, and it's clear already that there is a dizzying array of options for which legal business entity to choose for my business.

For example,


C corporation
sub-S corporation
Limited Liability Company (two
options here, one where the company income is treated the same as my
own personal income with regard to federal and state income taxes,
and the other where the company income is treated separately from my
own personal income)
Co-op
others?


For anyone that's already been down this road, please offer some specific factors to consider in choosing the right legal business entity in RI for a consulting firm with two options: (1) no anticipated retail sales at all, (2) a small amount of retail sales with most income anticipated to be only from professional services rendered.

For example, my accountant tells me that if I expect to have more than 10 employees then a sub-S corporation is a better solution because I won't be paying as much in taxes. If I recall correctly, with a C corporation, corporate profits are essentially taxed twice, one time for the corporate profit and another time for my personal income. He said this causes most C corporations to try to show a close to zero profit at the end of the year as possible, and that many of them end up re-organizing as sub-S corporations.

Maybe there are other factors to consider as well.

10,"I've learned through discussions with various people I've met in Rhode Island that there are many co-ops operating throughout the state that have never filed any kind of paperwork with the state government. For example, I think that the Secretary of State requires one to file articles of incorporation for many (perhaps all?) business entities formed in RI, but I've encountered more than ten different people who claim to be operating a co-op and who have also never filed any forms with the Sec. State.

This seems like an attractive option to me, but I'm skeptical that it is actually permitted by state law. Can anyone speak from experience on the legality (and if it is allowed, also the wisdom) of this choice? In particular, where (if anywhere) does the law elaborate on this type of business entity? I'd like to know specifics such as whether or not there are annual income limits and number of co-op member limits before the state will consider the co-op illegal.

11,"I've formed the impression from reading business news articles for several years that Delaware is often the state of choice for any small business to incorporate within. I guess there's something about the state law in Delaware that makes it a particularly attractive state for incorporating. I don't have specifics because this is just a general impression that I've developed from many different sources, but I've been unable to confirm it's accuracy.

But I don't actually intend to move to (or to do a significant fraction of my overall business endeavors in) DE, so in doing some research on this option while planning to remain in RI, I've encountered some RI state laws that seem to make RI-based businesses that incorporate in other states (as described above) subject to additional RI state taxes, thus making the option of foreign incorporation moot in RI.

So although I realize that this question could be interpreted as subjective (and thus, not well-suited to an SE Q/A community), my question is simply: Is there an ideal state in which to incorporate in the USA, and if so, why is it ideal? If someone can address the issues I raised in the second paragraph, I'd also appreciate that. This is perhaps a second question, but I think it's closely enough related that posting it as a separate question might be the wrong thing to do. In particular, if some states are known to make it more difficult (or impossible) to take advantage of foreign incorporation in states that are ideal for incorporating like DE, then I'd appreciate insights on that issue to. My impression as a Rhode Islander is that RI is indeed one such state, but perhaps there are other states that don't create obstacles to foreign incorporation, and if anyone here can list such states in your answer, then that would be a big help too.

I know, I know, this could perhaps be broken up into 2-3 questions, but again, I think they are all pretty closely related, so I'm posting as just one for now. Naturally I welcome suggestions for improving the question.

12,"I already understand the nature of the 24 month rule in regards to a single contract that lasts for more than 2 years. To recap:


From the point at which you know that your contract will be longer than 2 years you cannot claim travel expenses. 
If your contract is longer than 2 years from the outset you cannot claim travel expenses at all
It's fine to claim them up until the point that you know you'll be over the 2 years


What I'm unsure about and have had conflicting stories about, is in cases when you have many contracts during a 2 year period, with different clients, but in a similar geographical area. The majority of my contracts are in London but I don't know how far apart they would need to be to not fall foul of the rule. 

If there is no significant change in duration or cost, HMRC considers the workplace to be the same for the purposes of travel expenses. If that's the case, that would cover most locations in Central London, which can't be right. Can it?

I would like to know if there is any rule of thumb for determining whether you should use a fixed-price or a price per hour for these clients. For now, I'm using fixed prices because it adds clarity for both parties.

For the second type, fixed prices are fine. There is a clear functional design and I can estimate the time I'd need for it. For the client, a fixed price is good: they get what they want and they know how much it costs, unlike employees of which you don't know what you get for how much.

The first type doesn't have any knowledge of programming, most of the time, and doesn't know how much time the development of the product will take. A price per hour may seem useless to them. So if I'd use a price per hour, I'd have to give my clients at least a rough estimate of the time I'd need. This isn't a major problem, I can do that.  

What I'm more worried about is that, since those clients don't have knowledge of the subject, they cannot provide me with a good functional design. Most of the time it's more like ""can you make that somewhat lighter"" and such. I'm fine with all these minor tweaks, but it takes a lot time, especially contact-with-customer time. Therefore, I would be much happier to use a price per hour. However, that might destroy the good relationship with the client, as he would have in his mind that every minute costs money.  

A solution would be to make a functional design or layout before starting developing, and use a fixed price. However, I don't think I want that. For these clients, it's very hard to make up a nice layout without actually seeing it on the website. This would result in bad products.

In the US, employers are required to get your tax ID if they want to deduct the amount they pay you from their income, so it's reasonable for them to request it.

All of the remote work I've done so far has been for clients that were vouched for by someone that I trusted. In some of those cases, the client wouldn't make any payments until I sent them my Tax ID.

This question is specifically about dealing with a situation where you don't know anything about the client. For example: 


You reply to a listing they posted on a job site.
They contact you on your site or through a site where you've posted your resume.
They are not a large company with an easy to verify existence and history.
They are a small company, which may have been founded 10 years or 10 months ago.


So what do you do when a new client wants your tax ID before they will make any payments?

Is it reasonable to ask the client for references? If so, what kind of references and how should they be verified?

Some possible reference types I've thought of:


People who've worked for them.
Some of their clients/customers.

101,"I often stand in the situation where I can choose between doing something myself or outsourcing it to someone else. Or I have a chance to so some extra work in a situation where they are not able to pay my full rate. As an aid in both these situations, I would like to be able to calculate the cost (to me) for working one extra hour. This is very simple if I am 100% utilized, because then I can easily calculate the opportunity cost (cost = to what I am missing out on). But as most freelancers I am just roughly 50% utilized. How do I calculate what the cost of an hour of work is to me? Or in other words, coming back to my outsourcing decision, how much would I be willing to pay to get someone to save me one hour of work?

I know that the cost is just one part of the picture, as sometimes extra work can give me extra opportunities etc. etc. but it nevertheless helps to know the cost of my hours of work.

The perfect answer would probably involve some rough formula or rule of thumb.

Now the inevitable happened: the site got hacked. Now the client wants help as fast as possible, of course.

I don't like this task; it's no fun. If this wasn't my client, I’d probably decline this job. On top of that, this is bad timing because I have no time for it actually. But as I created the site some time ago and I'm ""his"" web designer, I feel responsible for him.

I’m thinking ""Damn, we you could have saved us me trouble if you’d have let me install security updates. Why didn't you listen?! Now I have to clean up this mess."". Could this be a reason to charge more for this job?

On one hand, I feel like I'd be taking advantage of an emergency case and maybe also letting him learn the hard way.

110,"I have a client who is not paying on time, but it looks like the specifics don't match similar questions on this SE site.

I got a call from a client I did website work for years ago. I had not done this kind of work for many years and frankly I'm not sure I want to now, but nevertheless about a month ago I agreed to bring his website, SEO, social media, and overall marketing for his small business up to speed. Why? He has told me many times how I'm the most honest, most well-informed contractor he's had experience with. And I personally kind of like him too.

So I started working on an hourly basis. I sent one very small invoice and got paid. Then we talked a whole lot about all sorts of feature he would like me to implement. I started that work, and sent a second invoice on the first of the month (one of my two stated billing days). I didn't get paid. On every invoice it states that I charge a whopping ten percent per week late. I sent many voicemails and emails asking to please let me know what's going on with payment, and didn't get replies. Then the 15th of the month rolled around (which I stated initially as one of my invoicing dates). Since I hadn't been paid for the last invoice, I simply didn't send him an invoice at that time but emailed him and said that I will combine it with the next scheduled invoice for this reason (probably a bad idea I realize). Eventually he sent a portion of the invoice payment. I emailed back to let him know that he's three weeks late and what the remaining balance is. 

Finally we got in touch via phone. He basically told me that he thought I hadn't done all of the work I said I did. He looked at the page source code and it didn't look complete to him.  I explained why his perception would be different and what work I had done as specified. He accepted this and said that part of the reason he didn't pay in full is that he's been swamped with personal family stuff, and part of the reason is that he didn't think I did all the work. That struck me as pretty weird. He also expressed concern that he has no idea now how much all the changes he has asked for are going to cost. And once again, he told me how honest and high-quality my services are compared to others he has dealt with. He also said he would pay me more (but not all) of the now three weeks overdue invoice that day. I didn't receive any payment. 

Basically this is how the client relationship strikes me:


He's not good at communication. He's very busy and English isn't his first language.
He almost never replies to emails but phone calls are fine. He's asked me to avoid emails for communication and I've asked him to please use email. 
He might not have enough money to afford all the things he has asked for. But so far I have been working for an hourly fee (which is quite high).
He also has started paying monthly for hosting and social media services from me. 
What seems very abnormal is for a client to be so overdue on payments and to actually withhold payment of an invoice without any communication because he didn't think the work was done.


I told him that I will send dollar estimates of each module of remaining work so that we can decide which ones are the highest priority if he cannot afford them all. I also reiterated that in the future if he has doubts about the work or an inability to pay, he must contact me immediately to say so.

I basically plan to state the following to him: I would like to work for him and help his business. I also have sympathy for his recent family difficulties. I am happy to figure out payment plans that would work better for him, but first I need to be paid in full for all outstanding invoices, especially given that I skipped one of them just to be nice. The most crucial thing I need is communication about any problems with my work or his ability to pay. Once again, he heeds to pay in full immediately before we negotiate anything else. 

Does the above seem like an appropriate communication? Is anything missing from it? Is anything I'm doing here really abnormal?

A week later, she wanted to meet again, and she had some changes to make to the scope.  Specifically, she wanted to expand it.

I explained that the additional scope would mean higher cost and later delivery date, which she was ok with (even though she had initially indicated that there was a hard deadline on the project).

I recommended that we start with a limited scope so that we can create an MVP before adding more features, but she was adamant that the additional features were necessary for the initial iteration (even though there would have been no difference in terms of pricing and time between producing the MVP in iteration one and then immediately beginning the second iteration to add the extra features that she wanted).

But, I agreed to the increased scope, she agreed to the increased cost and new delivery date, everybody seemed happy, and we got ready to start up again (at this point, the contract was still unsigned, and the initial invoice was still unpaid).

perfection in details
future-proof applications
top-notch graphics. 


To achieve something like this means that my projects take longer to finish, but the quality is the top one and the application is quickly appraised by the community (the client more quickly return money invested). Because of that I got a solid base of clients, both long-term and new ones recommended by other ex clients. And you would say this is ideal case? Umgh, no.

Then I asked myself if I am a nightmare boss - I don't think so. I usually leave contractors alone until they reach deadlines.

  Update: Sept, 2 The answers of @mysterycommand and @Hiroto gave some good insight and prompted me to be more clear. I've rephrased my question with explicit details; the intent is the same, hopefully clearer now.


As a freelance software developer I've run into a contract with a ""Work For Hire"" clause that effectively renders me an employee of my client. I have not signed this contract but it got me thinking:

At what point do you need your employer's permission to contribute to open source code you use on the job? (see scenarios below)

In software development it's common to use open source, permissively licensed software, i.e. ok for commercial reuse. The company you work for is not involved in open source but you choose to use it on the job (an application framework, blog, cms for instance). In the US, it's assumed your employer generally owns the copyright on work done on the job. In the course of doing your job, you write some code that you want to contribute back to the community — outlined are some examples:


You find a bug in a some open source code you're using at work and you fix the bug. You've changed a few lines at most, maybe even just a few characters. Do you need your employer's permission to submit a pull request to contribute your change back into the project's public repo?
You have a half finished piece of open source code you've started on your own time. During the course of your work on the job, you end up seeing the utility of your code so you choose to use your own previously written code. You end up needing to tweak the code, fix a function, or add a new feature so you can effectively complete your job. Do you need your employer's permission to publish the changes you made to the module you started on your own time but improved in the course of your work for the company?


The above two cases seem very grey to me, so insight would be helpful. Following is an example which seems less grey in terms of getting permission (it seems like an obvious yes) but takes the question to the next logical step:


In the course of you work on the job you see the utility in creating a reusable module that will save you time in future projects at work. You write this module and realize that it's a pretty good bit of software and other people (outside your job) may find it useful too and may even help you make it better. When you work for a company that is not active in the open source space, how does one approach conversations about the benefits of open sourcing work made on the job?


Asking this question has made me realize that it's important to be on the same page as your client. As freelancers, we can specifically walk away from projects which don't meet our standards (for instance I'm not sure Work For Hire is going to work for me). Also, it generally seems better to retain the rights to work created on the job in the case you want to contribute back to the open source community. As freelancers, we may need to take a WFH job (fiscally compelled) or have jumped into a contract without understanding ahead of time.

161,"A client has given me a contract that needs some changes before I'd sign it. I have no problem reading and doing basic research for a few pages of legalese. Most of the contract is fine but there are specific parts which I want to change.

Two paths occur to me:


Get a lawyer involved on my behalf
Express my concerns in plain language and have my clients lawyer incorporate the changes


Am I being naive assuming that option 2 is even a possibility?



Update

I got some legal advice, and it was a great help.

In five years of freelancing I've read probably a dozen different basic 1-2 page contracts that had very plain language and I had no problem understanding their intent, and felt comfortable with the terms.

Then I received a contract that was longer, more technical, and after a couple of hours of research I knew that some of it was over my head. After finding a local law firm  that I liked, I was able to parse through all of the confusion and I got to say, getting a lawyers help was a great idea. I found out that my reading of certain parts was maybe about %50 correct: I both completely misinterpreted the severity of certain statements and completely missed some problematic things.

179,"Background

I did some pro-bono work for a community organisation a year back which involved establishing a website prototype built from commercial third party services. Some services had a yearly recurring service fee, and during the prototype stage I - rather foolishly in retrospect - paid for a couple of these services with my own credit card in order to speed up the development process*. 

The community organisation did compensate me for this at the time and I had every expectation that any recurring billing arrangements currently linked to me would be transferred to the organisation prior to the next yearly payment. 

The organisation then had a change in management and direction; from a forward-thinking computer-literate president to one of those crypto-luddites we often assume don't exist in the 21st century. So now the organisation discards various ""online"" initiatives of the previous president, including this website prototype. This is irritating but I can accept it - it's the nature of pro-bono. 

Fast forward half a year, and for various reasons I have given up on helping this organisation**. So I handover all remaining digital assets and instruct them either de-link my credit card from any services they choose to keep - or close the services prior to the next auto-renewal charge. Since a few rare services for some insane reason I can't close myself despite being the owner of the associated billing account (credit card), I choose to trust the organisation to push through the appropriate business letterheads, etc. before I get charged in six month's time. They fail to do this.

I am now intend to interact with the service provider directly and get the service account closed and any errant auto-renewal charges refunded where applicable; regardless of any procedural nitpicking by the service provider's first-level customer helpdesk. I am after all the person actually paying the service. Due the community organisation's self-same sloth and incompetence, the services still have the same passwords and personal contact details as when I first handed over the prototype and instructed them to change these credentials.

Question

Is possession of a digit asset nine tenths of the law? 

If I am paying for a service; have no contractual obligation to the organisation for some ongoing gratuity or donation by way of funding this service; and I have (re)changed the passwords to assert sole control of the service account*** - is the service account essentially mine to close?

 * The organisation's sloth should have been my first clue. 
 * * Inept management practices; dispirited membership and volunteer outflow; a sharp swing towards regressive solutions; systemic structural flaws in the parent organisation; and so forth.
 * * * They also haven't exerted any ""habitual expectation"" through use or access to the services I'm paying for.

I'm trying to build an online portfolio that I can easily share with potential clients in the future and have everything in one convenient place where I'm in complete control.

My Research:

Based on what I've seen around the web, most web developers showcase screenshots of their work along with a description of the project, a few relevant details, and links to the actual website or web application.

The Problem:

With all honesty, some of my design work is not very flattering (to me at least) but those projects are still very important to me as some of them were done for major companies in Kuwait albeit on strict time-restraints. Also, as I mentioned earlier, some of my projects are network-based and are only accessible from within the company thus I cannot provide links to them. Additionally, I have a group of web applications that use the same design and interface so screenshots are not very convincing in this situation. I also recently found out that a company for which I build a website for back in 2010 has had their hosting account suspended for not paying. I don't want my future clients to jump to false conclusions based on something I had nothing to do with so I can't have a link for it either. That leaves with very few websites that are currently accessible to the general public and that bothers me.

182,"Briefing:

I recently decided to get serious about establishing my freelance web development business and one of my biggest issues thus far is with the payment procedures. In the past, I used to charge my clients by the service with 25% to 50% as down payment. I learned the hard way that this method is highly inefficient as I have no good way of knowing how much time is needed for a service, and how much I should actually be getting paid for it.

Eventually I ended up missing deadlines and working much more for much less. Therefore I decided that I want to charge by the hour and ideally, I want to have an arrangement in which I get paid for the time before I start with the work so I wouldn't waste my hours like in the scenario below.

Scenario (example):

I agreed on a project with a client, did work which wasn't fully covered by the down payment I received and when I finished, said client disappeared and left me with no payment and with finished project files that I can't reuse without heavy modification.

Research:

After a few days of research, I've learned that each project should be divided into several stages like Research &amp; Development (R&amp;A), Design, and Programming for example. I also learned that before sending out the actual quote to the client, first I must complete the R&amp;A stage so that I would know exactly what the client wants and charge accordingly and in a fair manner to both parties.

Problem:

I'm aware that there's the risk where the client is ""just looking around"" and I end up wasting several hours for nothing. Charging the client before actually starting the R&amp;A stage would just get me a lot of bad words as I haven't reached that level of professionalism yet. With that in mind, I would like to somehow be compensated for my hours in the R&amp;A stage while also getting the payment for the next stage so my hours wouldn't be a waste even if my client decides to go all David Copperfield on me. Any suggestions please?

185,"Briefing:

I'm a freelance web developer and I charge by the hour. I realized that my previous Research &amp; Analysis process was very inefficient and I'm looking to improve that to save more time and get better results. Most of my projects are for small companies and individuals looking for a start-up, but I do occasionally get larger projects. One of the steps I've taken is to split my R&amp;A process into two parts which basically are:

Preliminary R&amp;A:


Collect the basic project requirements from the client.
Review the project requirements and decide whether possible to accept the project.
Send an estimate to the client if the project should be accepted from my side.


If the client approves the estimate:

Follow-up R&amp;A:


Meet and review the results with the client to finalize the requirements.
Respond to the client with a detailed quote.


I drew my inspiration from this article: http://inspiredm.com/web-development-projects/

Problems:

Charging my clients for the preliminary R&amp;A is not logical but I'm not sure about whether I should charge for the follow-up R&amp;A and if no, how much time I should spend on it. Furthermore, I want to avoid unnecessary meetings and prefer a solution that would not take too much of my time even if the client was just looking around so to speak.

Research:

Apart from splitting my R&amp;A process in two, looking at how other freelancers deal with this problem, one possible solution that appealed to me the most, is to have an online questionnaire on my website that will send me the client's request via email for my review. If I do this right, then said online questionnaire will act as the preliminary R&amp;A thus saving me a lot of time. Though I'm not sure how that would impact my clients. It works well for me but would it work for my clients as well?

Summary:


Am I right to split my R&amp;A process in two parts?
Should I charge my clients for the Follow-up R&amp;A as per my hourly rate?
How do you think an online questionnaire would impact my future clients?
Should I mention my hourly rate along with the questionnaire?
Should I mention the general terms of agreement with the questionnaire?

The client gave me several red flags that lack of experience (and need for money) at the time caused to me to look past. Needless to say, it's November and we're still working.

My frustrations have grown out of their complete lack of trust in my skill and ability; they push past my recommendations for what their friends ""vote"" on, despite any facts, studies, ""proof,"" etc. I send to justify my choices.

Our terms state they are to pay my hourly rate for each round of revisions beyond the standard 3.

My plan is to deliver all of their files - code, design, etc. - to them once I receive that final 50% payment.

How do I manage a client's expectations for a new website?

The issue arises when they first see it go from mock up to actual working website. I'll give you the two approaches I have taken

Show them the end product only
Once I am happy with the site I will show this to them, but only once I am happy. This often results in phone calls of ""what is happening"" and ""where is the site can I see it now""? I do keep them in the loop with multiple emails per week so it doesn't look like I have run off - but clients seam to want to get their hands on it before they should. Note: all time-scales, with contingency, are laid out before hand.

Involve them in ever step
On the other hand I can show them the site every step of the way. However I have found when I do this they seam to like to request odd changes and get a bit confused with it all (understandable). The main issue is, it seams to encourage them to request more and more, and increasingly not-the-right-thing changes; though they do not take kindly when I say ""this is the way to do it"". It just seams as I say that this encourages more changes, though the benefit is if there is anything they really do not like we catch it early on.

So my question is really: Are there any approaches I have missed or is this just as hazard of the job and I should accept the lesser of two evils (the first I am currently thinking!)

269,"A few years ago I had an enquiry from a potential client who was an acquaintance of a friend. 

I had my doubts early on that he was a scammer but initially gave the benefit of the doubt, and then continued out of curiosity as to what he would do, with no intention of ever parting with money or doing work without a full contract in place. 

The following is a brief outline of some of our interactions, along with alarm bell triggers, which I include mainly for the benefit of those who may face a similar situation and who may want to know how such a scam might progress (questions at the end):


Initially very hazy about what his business did. Didn't seem to be able to give an adequate explanation of how it worked, his product or target market.
Vague and suspicious story about previous web designer who disappeared without finishing the job (I asked him about any previous sites or design work carried out on his business). There were a few graphics and a page of text but there never was an actual website for the business.
Met in small rented office with no phones, computers or filing cabinets.
Checked out the business name on Companies House register (the official UK corporation register for those who don't know) and the name is listed there but I didn't pay the fee to get more details. Thought it could be a sign of legitimacy.
A phone call one evening that he had to pay an urgent bill but all his payment cards and cheque books were locked in a filing cabinet for which he had lost the key. Wanted to borrow money from me to pay for a locksmith and to help pay the urgent bill (first major alarm bell that made me conclude this was most likely a scam in progress). I said I couldn't help with that and to have a chat with his bank.
Silence for about 6 months. Then another phone call wanting to continue the web development work.
More vague information over the phone followed by a face-to-face meeting in which he requested to borrow from me £2000 to help with some cashflow problems and said he would pay me back ""generously"". I said I'm not in a position to help with those sorts of things.
I didn't hear back from him for about a year. Then I got an email out-and-out just asking for £20,000 to help with his business (again offering to make it ""worth my while""). I ignored it.
Another year or so, last November, he contacts me again and is just interested this time in getting the website built again. I'm curious to see what he says this time so I go along with it. I tell him I can't meet him but we can talk on the phone. He says he has dissolved his last business (checked out Companies House register and the business name is listed as dissolved). I checked their list of disqualified directors and his name does not appear there.
He is reluctant to call me asking me to call him because of the cost of his mobile phone tariff. He wants me to always call him (though it also costs me more to call mobiles!). He does not have use of a fixed-line phone and uses a public telephone box when I ask him for fixed-line number to call.
I email him my contract and fee schedule and tell him I need his signature and an address to send it to (thinking it would put him off) - he seems willing to sign it; however, he keeps telling me how his business is in the process of being ""reconstituted"" and they don't have an address yet but I can send the contract to the address of one of his ""associate partners"" whose office he is temporarily using (in the same serviced office building as before).
He was also reluctant to register the domain via my web hosting website and he wanted me to register it for him and add it to the overall bill for web development. I told him I keep the two services separate (partly because I prefer to do it that way, but also I wanted to see if he would give an address after I told him the domain can be seized if he provides false information). He is making vague excuses for not doing that.
Now he is saying things like ""you said you would start on this date"" and ""there seems to be a miscommunication"" and ""I can go to someone else to do the website if you prefer"".
I have just now told him that I expect him to sign and return the contract before I start doing any work and that he needs to sign it either as an individual providing his home address, or as a representative of his company providing the trading address that is registered with Companies House.


UPDATE: A month later I receive no reply after asking for a home or registered trading address - the strongest evidence of a scam, I think.

Questions:


Are scams like this widely experienced by other freelancers / small businesses?
What can be done to inhibit the risks of people falling for such scams?
As he has done nothing illegal yet, are there any standards, quality-control, or investigatory groups that monitor/investigate potential scams from B2B clients / customers?


There are usually several official/unofficial organisations that monitor &amp; investigate unscrupulous traders and service providers but, as far as I am aware, none that look into clients.

I have developed an app in Play Store and then I got approached by a client in Facebook to build a translation of a religious word as an app. He said he will give me $50 for the app and gave me the website too from which I have to parse the content. I used the the content and gave him 5 prototypes at every 15 to 20% of progress. I had completed it in 3 weeks of full work and had sent him the work with 99% of it completed. Only the icon has to be provided for the app.

Then I sent it to my friends for testing the app and they said to me that $50 is too less for the work. They told me of the developer fees per hour. They asked me to calculate the rate as $5/hr and it will cost to a minimum of $100. So I just asked the client of the hourly developer rates and asked his opinion of giving me $100 and didn't demand him. 

He said he can't and I said I can give him for $50. But he said it's too unethical to discuss the new rates once the rate is fixed and said he doesn't need my app at all. He asked me to delete my project files and he doesn't care about the work and broke off. 

I have the app with 99% work completed and now its vain and 0% percent as the content of translation I used was a copyrighted one and I can't publish it. It's not about the money much but the client treated my work like trash and it worries me a lot. 

But I used the app as a framework and made Bible and sold it for ($125). So as someone new to freelancing, how can I know if I am being underpaid? 

If I had accepted the client for the work with less and if the app grows then how can I approach him?

Due to outsourcing how can I calculate the cost?

271,"We were asked to do a few jobs via oDesk, elance and guru freelance websites. While working via these services, I noticed that there are many ""companies"" there who basically use these services to find clients and at the same time their company members have accounts there, attached to its company account. Even more, their workers will bid the project and negotiate the clients, while all earned money goes to company's pocket and they only receive crumbs. 

Now, how is possible that such companies work and make a profit when their workers can see the price of every job? Aren't workers discouraged from knowing the price of a job and comparing it to what they get? These people mostly work hourly for small sums of money. 

Let me elaborate the question: the first thing I learned when started working for a company was that I never knew how much they charge their clients. I am getting my monthly salary and I don't care if my company earns $1000 or $1000000. It's better if the company is earning a lot because I will have a salary, but in general it was not my concern. We heard stories about how we were working on on multi-million dollar projects, but we were never able to know how much they charge their clients for our work. And we could do nothing because we were not in their league - their clients would not even talk to us, God forbid they offer us a multi-million dollar job. So after a couple of years I figured out that I can earn more and work in a less stressful environment by working as a freelancer, so I quit and became a freelancer. 

The story of mine is not unique. It's a story of every freelancer here. 

Now, back to my question. When you have clients and workers on the same network where workers can see earnings of their bosses, how can such a company survive? Why would some person work for $10/h if you see that your company is charging the client $100/h? Shouldn't such a worker go to their boss asking for a higher hourly wage for that job? Or start working alone for the same (or larger) amount of money without pressure, from your own home? And yet, they have workers who work for them for years. 

A majority of people would become envious and angry just by knowing that their boss is earning 10 times more on your work working with clients you can also reach (approach to). These websites are not Intel or Kodak or USPS company where you can never reach CEOs. Here you have a direct access to the client.

For the 3rd time, how do such companies remain on the market? Why would I work for someone giving me A dollars per hour, if I can see he earns 5xA per hour? Even though I understand the whole principles of a business, I don't think I would be able to work as quality as I in cases I don't know how much my boss charges our clients.

I asked the owner of the company to produce some work before I can make the first payment request of $700 so he gave me a 10 mock up design of the website within a week. After completing another 20 pages of design in TWO months, he requested another $300 before starting the coding part.

Four months have now passed since the project started and I have paid him in total $1000. The coding is near completion but still needs some work, and obviously bug fixing done before actual testing can take place. A couple of days ago I asked him to put the site on my staging server so my testers can test the site for any issues. His answer was that ""I need to pay the rest of the money before it can be uploaded to my server"". I tried to convince him that the site is still not complete yet and needs to be tested for any bugs, issues etc. I made it clear to him that I am not going to pay the rest of the money, which is another $1000, without having any knowledge of product quality or any ownership of the finished product. But he did not listen to any of my points and kept on telling me that this is the company policy and he can not change it. 

After try to reason which him for a long time, I told him that I would pay another 25% more  which is 75% of the total cost if he would upload the untested work to my staging server and allow my testers to test the website. But he would not even agree to my reasonable offer and kept telling me that I need to pay at least 80% which is the $1000 which I have paid plus another $800. I told him that is too much money without anything in my hand. Then he said that I can let my tester test the site on his server and pay when finished. I did not agree to it and since the coversation was not going anywhere we decided to end it.

284,"Please take your time to read the below otherwise click elsewhere. I will try and make it short but I feel I need to explain the situation fully so that you guys can help me decide whether my quotation is on point.

Hey guys, I'm glad there is a place on stackexchange to ask this question.

I have a great client, our business relationship has extended for a year now and I've offered him two solutions for his two businesses. I charged him £9k each. Everything went smoothly both iPad based applications were completed. 

I flew to my client's country to take down all requirements in full for the third project. A full electronic college application. Then he realised that it needed to be put on hold and instead he would need a payrolls application for the college first since he makes payments to his staff members every month and the majority of his payroll office have quit knowing that it will all be electronic based in the future, hence the urgency for the payroll application.

Now, its a bummer because it does mean the price I wanted to charge will have to be reduced since hes reduce the project scope. This project will include the following:


a Biometric system that will interface with my application, it will clock in and out staff members attendance for payroll. These machines would be laid out around the college entrances and exits, and at the security office for security staff to clock in and out too.
client's iPad will display dashboard data, how much money he needs to
pay his staff members at the college, in cash and to the banks.
There would also need to be another module at the payroll office where one staff member can check exactly which staff member is owed how much cash, with a printer printing out invoices/a little staff payroll sheet that will print that the cash was collected.
a timetable module for the head teacher of the college to be able to see all staffs time tables for when they should be in and when not.
To be able to edit staff's working hours.


For this project application for one business only he will be quoted around £23k. 

This is fine, however I received a call a month ago where he's requested for these additional features.


He now wants a centralised payroll system for ALL of his businesses, (theme park, college, food company with head office and factories, hotel, and the future hotels that he is building) each business have staff members ranging from 30+ staff members, to 200+ staff members.
To be able to add biometric machines in the future, as many as he likes, that can be placed in his future businesses and any new businesses that he starts up.
To be able to monitor his range of businesses from his app all in one place. 
So he can continue to implement a biometric full system in every single new business he opens with this application.


This is then means that he would no longer need to come back to me everytime he wants to implement a new biometric system for his other business and future businesses since my application would now be able to handle new biometric devices being added.

This is like an unlimited license that he's asking for. How much should one charge for a situation like this? What should be my multiplier?

Here's what I dont want to do:


Charge him for every new device that's added into the system say £2k for every new device. That's silly for me.
I also don't want to charge him for every new business he wants to extend the application for


So I have decided to give him a one of fee, the question is how much? I have thought about multiplying the original price by 2.3, £23k x 2.3 = £53k.  

And thought of increasing maintenance by £2k increments for each new branch he extends within the app for every year after his initial 1 year free app maintenance.

Am I charging too much or am I charging too little for this unlimited license?

UPDATE 1

In regards to one question from one of the answers: The businesses that he will continue to install this application for will be his own businesses so that he can monitor the accounting information that would be automatically tracked. The information that will be tracked is how much to pay his staff members each month through the biometric system that he wants to continue to install and monitor in his future businesses to come.

Now I have some questions.


Since I have multiple project in working and in queue, should I fix those bugs immediately if the support period has not expired or I should tell the client that I will fix it as soon as I have free time? What I am asking is does free support mean that I have to fix bugs immediately or simply free but in my free time?
As you see I am confused with ""support"" and ""retainer"" terms. Since I see support as whether I will charge the client or not, while retainer means to me immediate action on any issues. 
What is the optimum free support in terms of duration? Is 1 month too short or is 3-month period too long? Should we offer free support at all since we're freelancers, not companies?


I am basically asking how do you handle such situations. Since right now the client hired me 40 hours a week and it's not fair I cut from 8-hour day work by doing bug fixes. And yet again, fixing those bugs at night is error prone since I am tired.

Recently, multiple clients returned to me asking for bug fixes, and it's hard to handle ongoing projects and bug fixes. Yet again, I don't want to be the one who charges any hours spent working on some task especially when it comes to bug fixing.

306,"So I have secured a project worth 6 figures for an employee management system that will manage his employees for 4 of his companies. This employee management system will integrate a biometric hardware solution on computer stations that communicate with iPads (for the managers/receptionist of each company) all connected to a cloud based server. The project will last around 3 months, and the customer is entitled to as many small intricate software changes as they like in the first year after which the service costs £8,000 a year to maintain the solution I'm about to implement.

Problem:
Thats all great, but I'm having a hard time trying to explain I will be charging them 8k a year to keep things running after the first free year.

Here are my reasons for charging that:

Main two reasons


I Blaaaady worked so hard in that first free year implementing all the feature changes that they suddenly realise they require new quick to implement, small feature upgrades sometimes big in the current software implementation that I feel I need to make my money back on the second and third year because of the extra hours put in after project completion.
Apple no matter what will have Yearly iOS operating system upgrades for all devices, and so will the MAC OS X. So these applications will have to be updated regardless yearly anyway.
Back ups of the server, and databases. &lt;- this sounds really silly when I tell the client this. 


Small extra reasons but that don't necessarily weigh significantly on the SLA cost


I provide the client direct access to me, 24/7 telephone service as opposed to emails or any other communication method or having to go through my receptionist, I save that for the smaller projects. My client loves this and sure does use it whenever possible by dropping me many texts whenever a new feature is required, or when he needs something to change in the back end.
Server costs, this is such a nominal amount that I could just pay this out of my own pocket since it only costs about £40 a month, not that I would take up the cost ;) 
Flexibility - we provide a no problem service attitude.


Everything is run on my side, if I wanted to, I just have to redirect the server elsewhere and all applications will cease to exist for the other projects I've worked on with this client.

But as far this goes, that's it. My client is asking me what will happen after the first free year if no updates are required in the second year, will he still need t pay the 8k? It's a good question, but that's not the point, I've told him these are the running costs for managing the service that I am providing.

Could someone please help me on outlining other important things that I am possibly missing from this SLA agreement that could help justify the cost? I find the app development aspect of it is more than enough to justify that cost, since some companies charge £25-30k in upgrades and app revisions where as he is able to come to me at any time of the year and send me a new list of features required with no hassle.

So, a company that expects about 30-60 day commitment/expectation with only a possibility of further projects following would assume a higher contracting rate.

What I'm struggling with is when companies ask about your last long term rate, then assume they'll just have the same rate for a short commitment.  How do people normally handle the quoting process around this?  What if they ask your rate before committing to whether it is a 30 day or 6 month project expectation?   Or, do you just use one averaged rate and take whatever length project they offer?

EDIT:
This can also apply to a contract-to-hire compared to full time role.  I'd assume a 1099 contract-to-hire with no benefits would be a higher rate, but companies want to assume it is the same rate as a full time job, just no commitment.

This is a general question because we are a small team of freelancers suffering from same problem. For workload I mean, that we are doing stuff that was not discussed when we agreed to work together and this costs higher.

For example, we agreed 10$/hr for 40hrs/week. So a fulltime contract.  After the project has grown more work is needed to be done, which requires for the contract to be reviewed. We are doing this work with the same hour rate, because we had good working relationship.
Things have changed, the customer offers only 15-20hours to work, so I obtain 50% of payments. He doesnt want to review the contract as he will ""soon"" find investors and I'll get the same 40hrs. But that does not happen. New customers demand 40hrs/week envolvment. So to work on new people I need to termnate the current contract or live on receiving half or less of agreed payments.
On the other hand, the new customer agrees to pay more $/hr as this is the new average hour rate for this work.

Lets assume that the second client hired you because you have such great Widget experience.

Further, if writing a Widget Editor from scratch generally takes 10 hours to piece together, but because you can reuse some of your past code it will probably just take 5 hours-- should you charge them for the original estimate or pass the time savings from the reused code you've previously written.

The first sticking point is totally on me and my naivete, I never got a concrete set of requirements from them before starting work. It's an upgrade job and their requirements were basically ""like the old system, but better."" Lesson learned there.

The bulk of my frustrations is a never ending cycle of lax QA testing, minimal feedback, and feature creep. I ask questions and responses take weeks, if they're addressed at all. I put new features or parts of the system in the testing environment, tell them to test it out, whole months will go by before I hear anything. When I do hear back, without fail, their testing reports contain a laundry list of new requirements, either things they forgot to tell me about initially or new features they insist are necessary to the system. Then they ask why it's taking so long...sigh.

I've been paid half the quoted amount already per the pricing schedule set up in the SOW and I'm seriously considering dropping them as a client and just taking the hit. I've already spent 3 times as long as I thought I would simply because I've had to gather the requirements as I went along.

Where I think hourly billing is the most transparent way to bill, the other side has written, extensively I might add, on why it isn't and one should go for fixed price instead. 

In my opinion the way you charge a project does not determine whether you charge unethically or not. I can charge more hours than I actually worked because I actually work much faster than the customer thinks I do. 
On the other hand, fixed price projects offer an ideal opportunity to set a price that is too high which the customer will always be forced to pay whether a project took three weeks or only one to complete.  

---edit: clarification that the question is not about ethical business in general, but specifically billing ----

I understand doing business in an ethical way does not need to be determined by the billing, if you want to pull one over on your customer it can be done in any way number of ways. However, I think hourly billing at least is the best way to bill: you are transparent on the amount of work you performed and that's what you bill. No black box lump sum amount which may or may not represent work. If you want to account for experience and skill, just raise your hourly price.

It is designed with two kinds of clients in mind: those who want to redesign their website now (as a preliminary step) and those who want to just see how well their website is doing.

I'm not yet sure how many usability evaluations I could accommodate per year or what the demand is.  For this discussion, let's suppose I'll do one per month, alongside my design services.  

Since my prospects vary greatly in size and budget, I want to offer this service in different tiers.  On the higher tiers, I want to use third-party tools to give clients a deeper evaluation of their website.  The highest tier, or an alternative service (I haven't decided yet) would also involve my checking a client's website, as well as the website of one of their competitors.  (Here is another vendor which does competitive evaluations on a much larger and deeper scale.)

One of the third-party software products I would be using has a freemium model.  The lower-end usability evaluations would employ its free version.  The higher-end usability evaluations (which would cost around $3500-4000 at present) would be using the paid version of the tool, which provides more features and analyzes sites more deeply.  I have not bought this tool yet because no clients have asked me to use it yet.  

The paid version of the tool costs about $500.  Based on where my business is right now (recovering from having done a substantial amount of work for free), this isn't a trivial cost.  But using this tool in my more in-depth evaluations would give me a nice advantage over my competitors, for clients willing to pay for more labor from me.  (My competitors work in a related industry but a different field.  There is some overlap between their fields and mine.)

How would you handle the cost of this tool?


Charge $500 to every client who wants me to use it, since no clients have asked for it yet?
Charge $500 to only the first client who wants me to use it, and then other clients who want it later don't have to pay for this?
Charge a percentage of $500 to all clients who want me to use it, to amortize its cost?  (If so, what's a good amount to charge?)
Raise my hourly rate for all services?  (This may be hard.  Clients in my industry may resist paying the higher rates of UX designers already.  They are used to web designers, who are on average less expensive.)

I really want to fire this client, but he is relying on me to manage his team and lead this project, so he's not going to be very happy with me at all. He's absolutely convinced that this is the Best Idea Ever. How do I get myself out of this without ruining my oDesk rating?

Is there a minimum amount that will not unfairly compete with British IT companies or other freelancers? How much should this minimum be?

By searching the internet I found this:


  ...you could be looking at the following price ranges in the UK from a reputable web agency:
  
  
  A small static web site with approximately 5-10 pages, design, coding, content and content optimisation, W3C Strict compliance: £2,000 - £5,000
  As above with 20-30 pages £4,000 - £8,000
  Content managed web site allowing you to add pages, upload content and images and create search engine friendly pages with compliant code output 8,000 - £15,000
  Bespoke database or e-commerce web site with specific requirements and content-management facility £10,000+

383,"Background: I am a software engineer. Throughout my career I have been a salaried employee.

My brother's company has some imminent deadlines and they could use some extra help with things that I have a lot of experience with; I recently discussed with his boss about possibly doing consulting and she seemed very excited about the idea. I already told them that while I'd love to help them with 10-20 hours per week, I'm not interested in leaving my current job nor moving (he and his company are in a different state).

The question: I have never ""applied"" to work as a contractor before, and I'm wondering what is different about the process. A few questions:


Resume: My brother asked me to give their HR department a resume. I think of myself more as a vendor than as an employee, is this request typical for contracting?
Compensation:


How much should I quote my hourly rate to be? I'm not asking for a number, I'm asking for the markup from what my time is worth, the fact that I need to pay extra for social security, etc. In other words, should I ask for 20% more? 50% more? Other?
Should I try to negotiate a bonus in advance? I know they are really pressed by deadlines, should I ask for something like ""if we get done by this calendar date, I'd like a speed bonus of X% more"". Is that sort of thing normal or should it just be a simple rate?

Expenses:


If I need to buy a commercial software tool, how do these costs get calculated? Should I just roll this into my hourly rate? Should I expect them to pay for it and expect to give them the license when the project is complete?
I want to buy a new laptop. I was going to do this anyway even without this consulting gig. My brother's boss seemed skeptical about giving me VPN access on a personal laptop, but it didn't seem like a dealbreaker. How should this factor into the negotiations?
They want me to form an LLC for myself. The fees are reasonably high to do this. Should I attempt to build this into my hourly rate as well?

Is there anything else I should know?

391,"I recently did some web design samples for a client. The client was looking for an e-commerce website and wanted to see samples of what I intended to make the site look like. They were very adamant on the samples either being right the first time, or they were going to decline and move on to a different developer (should have taken this as the first bad sign, right?). I never had a client with this sort of mentality before (usually clients ask for revisions until it looks good, then move on), so we agreed that if they liked the samples, they would pay a 50% down payment and I would start development on the site (no extra cost for the samples). If they did not like the samples, they would only owe $100 for the work spent creating the samples for them. These terms were agreed upon via email as well as verbal.

Needless to say, after sending the samples they informed me that they did not like them and were going to find someone else (ouch). No problem, I sent them an invoice for the $100. I received an email the next day stating that they disliked the samples so much that they refuse to pay for them (double ouch). I politely apologized that they did not like the samples but due to the terms of our agreement, a $100 fee was owed for the work I did for them.

Today is the due date for the payment before a 5% late fee as written in our agreement. Since they don't appear to be anywhere near paying today (they aren't responding to my curtesy reminder emails either), I assume they have no intention of paying at all. I realize it's only $100, but the client was rude regarding the rejection and with the samples in hand, they could realistically bring them to another developer to use without me getting a dime.

My Question: What is a reasonable approach to getting the money the client agreed to pay me? Most options seem to cost more than the amount due.

For reference: Both parties are from Texas, USA (Dallas area); I have a written document regarding the terms of the work and design--my work did not breach the terms at all; I have email documentation regarding the $100 fee should they choose to not continue on with the project afterwards.

Once the client decides to go with my services, I charge them 50% off the full cost of service, to be paid within 5 days upon agreement. This payment secures their date.

I'd like to find a software that allows me to have a single ""sales order"" (the bi picture), but which allows me to invoice the customer off of that order twice, for the corresponding 50% payments.

This would allow me to have independent due dates for the two payments, and have greater accuracy on who owes money, who is on track, and especially, how much money is planned to be coming in during the following months. Suppose a customer has an event in June and I will charge her $1,000. $500 of that amount should be considered for money coming in this month, while another $500 should be assigned to the Money coming in during June category.

We offer hosting and maintenance, which most clients take, for a monthly fee. This fee is kept as 'company money' for paying the bills and for other purchases. I'm currently using a personal 'e-savings' account for this which had no other use. I pay all the bills myself so this works. We're looking at opening a business bank account soon.

Side note: I trust the guy I'm working with, I highly doubt they'll be any issues working with him with regard to money.

My question is:


Is this a good way to do things? How would we improve the way we work?
We're not earning enough to be paying tax. But are there any problems with the way we're operating? (UK) We're not in any way 'registered' or official.
If we did this full-time how should we change the way we work? I'd envisage pooling contact income and paying ourselves a salary, work varies though so this amount would also vary.

FYI: I am based in London, England (UK)

What I miss from time to time, especially in salary negotiations, is kind of a formula / system to exactly explain to my customer why I charge what I charge. So I started to develop something. 

My current calculation is based on an Entrepreneurs Salary (based on what I could earn as an employee) plus Healthcare/Social Insurance, Taxes and Operating cost (Hardware, Tax Counsel, ...).

This, I compare to the work hours per year based on how many hours I would work as an regular employee minus the time I need to invest for administrative Stuff, Planning and aquiring new jobs in order to get a hourly rate equal to regular employment.

What I miss in my calculation is Risk. There are certain risks that i just won´t have as an employee. (Especially in Austria where I live you are secured against almost everything as an employee - be it a longer leave due to illness or accident, or if your employer declares bankruptcy) 

Right now, the difference between my hourly rate and the calculation to be even with an emoloyee (in the terms mentioned before) is 15%, what i see as my calculated risk.

I´ve already done some reasearch on the web, but I still can´t find any values I could compare my 15% against. So what I am looking for is a percent value (EDIT: or a range), backed by some credible source or professional experience for usual values for calculated risk.

434,"I work for a custom wine cellar company and have been their one and only designer for a year and half now. The owner used to do the design, but you can't run a company sitting behind a mouse designing all day, so he got me. 

I have a degree that I learned in AutoCAD. I never got to use it, and when I found this company, the owner asked me if I knew SketchUp, which is what we use. I learned the program, and started doing small designs for $13.50 per hour and was quickly moved up to $15 per hour. My boss told me not long after that he was already thinking about my next raise; he didn’t know when it would be or how much but just wanted me to know it was on his mind. That was about a year ago. He has since then told me more than once that my list of responsibilities has grown more than he ever intended, and he was please with my work. 

Now they have brought up the idea of paying me by the designs that sell and taking an hourly cut or being independent altogether, requiring me to do a 1099, which is fine with me. I have thought to request a minimum for each job so I know if a design sells, I am guaranteed at least that much. 

As of now, I take a design request form. I create a SKP file for the dealer and home owner or business and create the cellar they have dictated with our cabinet options. Sometimes I am given free range and have done quite well. They have said they would like to pay me a percentage of each job that sells but that is hard to get income in mind when we may sell one cellar a week or we may sell six and they can range from $3000 up to $45K. The average, I suppose, is around $7 to $10k. 

We have a custom wood shop with about 20 employees that get paid too. I create  3D design presentations for our dealers to take to their customers. The design comes back for at least one revision to tweak something normally. Once we sell it, we take a 50% deposit, and I create a 2D design with measurement of the room and all wine racks for the dealer/home owner to sign off on. This ensures the racks fit. 

That same document I then pair with a cover sheet and very detailed component list for the shop to create the cellar. We then ship freight, UPS, or maybe even have the customer come pick it up if they are close enough and so choose. 

Since I was hired, they have purchased a $135k dollar CNC machine and several other large saws and sanders. The money is obviously coming in. He has even hired more shop labor since I came on, maybe four or five people. 

We state that we require a $50 design fee on our request form, but it isn't enforced, and it is just hidden in the final price (should that be mine or is that small potatoes for what I should be concerned with). 

I act as a designer, office help when needed, and have for a while now been dealing with our lead dealers directly and any questions about a design or quote usually comes back to me.

I'd like to give to my customer a new version of the contract I use for ERP programs (and not for import/export utilities as I did with him), with higher prices for the initial software cost, annual maintenance and other contract conditions.

The project is nearly completed. How can I tell all of this to the customer? I'm afraid he could reply ""Hey, we have agreed to this price, I'll pay you only that.

Update - 7th July 2017

I followed the advise to list all the extra features, but the customer kept changing point of view just to be right whatever I said. After sending him a copy of old e-mails to show how his mind (hem...) was not serving him well, he started to say he has an intellectual property on the calculations (it's a weighted average that I suggest to use...).

I offered him the option to pay me nothing more, keeping the part of software he payed, but he had to delete my software (the part not payed) otherwise he was infringing my copyright. I sent also a license agreement. He never answered.

After that, I talk with a lawyer, a friend of mine, who offered to send him an order for payment just to unblock the situation. After a few days he asked if he had to talk to his lawyer or we could find an agreement. I offer the possibility to an agreement.

He told me he wanted to wait for a change in the law since maybe my software (not payed) could be useless for him after that. I tried to let him understand that I worked for that software and the fact he had to pay me had nothing to do with the fact that law can change.

After more than 6 months the law eventually changed and he needed no more my unpaid software... but he don't want to delete it neither.

Nearly a year has passed since that time. He even said to me that that piece of software could be helpful for him even with change in the law, I just have to fix bugs before he can pay... (obviously I don't trust him anymore).

I'm upset and annoyed. I don't know if the story will end in some other way. For sure I learned the lesson. In case of news I will update this post. I think it can be of help to others, just as an example not to follow.

I began developing an application where the client negotiated a pretty low price (it's my first production development gig, after all) in return for two promises:


He'd cooperate with any trouble due to bugs, so long as I fixed them quickly.
He'd help me sell the app for full price to 2-3 other business owners in his line of work.

I'm aware with any business you have to protect yourself. Below are a few issues I one day expect to come across and need to know how to protect myself. 

""You've deleted some of my files"" - I haven't but I'm likely to get accused of this at some point. I could backup their data before hand but this is not only time consuming but I am then keeping hold of their private data.

""You've been viewing my private data"" - I haven't, but they may accuse me of this.

""My computer is still full of viruses"" - the truth is when I handed it back to the client it was virus free and shortly after they've downloaded more viruses and are accusing my of not doing my job properly!

""My computer is now worse"" - let's say they hand me a PC which is crumbling. I use it for an hour and something blows up (e.g power supply) and I'm accused of breaking the machine.


How best to cover myself against these points? There are many more but I can't see how I can cover everything so what's the best practice?!
I guess the only way around any of these is to cover all these points in a contract and before any work takes place the client must sign it? Is replying to an email with the contract attached sufficient/legal?
For remote work, how best to take payment? If I don't take payment before, once the PC is repaired they could cut the connection and never speak to me again. If I do take payment, they may have to do it online - if their computer is full of viruses this is not wise for obvious reasons.

He set out with an idea of what he wanted to end up with for this website and it's not a bad design by any means, but the product has evolved and he still seems caught in his original expectations of perfection. I don't consider what we've changed to be compromises at all, we've made some huge improvements and made some processes way more automated than was ever imagined back in the days of V1. But now he's trying to apply the same degree of user-input and the same expectations to a completely different system. He's making suggestions that just don't really make sense and aren't necessary with the new workflow.

Anyways, we're still in the early stages of our beta--we haven't gone a full day without something going wrong at some point yet--and he's started focusing on a particular feature that only applies 2% of the time. He's calling it our top priority when, again, we haven't even gone a day without other, more severe problems popping up. But he insists that this 2%-case is much of what's holding up his work, even though he's still managing to get what he's supposedly blocked on done.

He doesn't understand the technical aspects so I try to explain things to him in laymen's terms, but today he emailed me to say that he had actually brought our problem to another developer asking for advice. Aside from the frustration that goes with his priorities being clearly wrong, this is also somewhat embarrassing to me: he went to a developer asking a dumbed-down question and saying I didn't know how to fix it.

How do I explain all this to him, but in a way that won't strain the relationship or provoke him to just start messaging me more and more about irrelevant things while I'm trying to work?


I know what I'm doing, and he can trust me to design the software in a way that he'll learn to prefer after a couple weeks. Not to mention, he can trust that I'll resolve problems or ask for help on my own, and that I won't (and couldn't possibly) tell him every technical detail about every problem I face in the day, since facing problems is more or less my job description.
That we should build a working product before we start worrying about the minor intricacies of how it works.

I could go into detail and write out paragraph upon paragraph of everything I know as a developer and everything that's ever happened in my life that might apply here, but that's just a waste of my time and theirs. Generally I explain at a super top-level, knowing that if they don't really understand it but think they do, it'll all be resolved in a day or two and it won't have made any difference.

That works in most cases, but sometimes I find an email in my inbox from them saying something along the lines of:


  So we know you've been having some trouble with this one problem so we spoke with a developer friend of ours and told him you've been facing this, and he suggested you try this.

465,"Customers always want  a quotation of the amount of time it will take to write a certain feature (printing a new report, adding a new form, importing/exporting data, etc). 

Suppose I estimated the correct amount of time needed (seldom happens), then I can get an accurate quotation simply using hours &times; hourly rate. Wonderful!

But things seldom go as planned, and customers actually wanted the feature a little different with respect to what I had implemented. So I would need to change this little thing, maybe the font, 'blue' color in 'dark blue', dash line into dotted line, ... all easy '5 minutes' task, delivered one at a time to let the customer to verify the result... and each little task needs a little test time, a little commit time, more time to compile and upload the upgrade to the customer... so I added extra work (adjustments) for free. Maybe the estimate was 2 days but in the end I actually worked 3 days for the same amount of money.

Because the price quotation is fixed I cannot ask for more money. The little changes are to fulfill the 'correct desired result', for customer&mdash;programmer misunderstandings or things unsaid (think about the tree-swing comic ;-) ).

In other cases, I think the hourly rate is not applicable since my quotation would be too high with respect to market price. There are little tasks that are a bit tricky and require a lot of time to make things work yet no one will spend hundreds of dollars for it (at the moment I cannot find an example). 
So I feel I'm forced to write as a quotation something similar to the 'market price' (pretending I will resell this feature to someone, sometime in the future).

In both cases I ended up doing a certain amount of work, for a very low hourly rate. As you may imagine I feel frustrated at times since I don't even get the 'hourly rate',  the though to 'gain something' seems an impossible dream.

I've been a freelance designer for a bit more than a decade. I work from home. I don't really have any complaints in terms of the projects, work, money, clients, hours, etc. Well, no more complaints than would be considered standard in the course of a week.

However, I find myself terribly isolated and not necessarily by choice.

A bit of background for clarity: 


I am single, never married, no children, and no immediate family. In fact, only distant family across the country I haven't really seen in 25 years or more.
I'm not a drinker. Therefore I tend not to venture out to pubs, bars, or parties. 
I'm a steadfast atheist so church or religious gatherings are best avoided, otherwise I simply anger people.
I don't feel anything on the internet - Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, discussion forums, SE - is really socializing. Ultimately you're still by yourself typing. In addition, simply repeating what I do for a living is not a break from work.
I know people, well, I know a few couples. But couples don't tend to hang out or socialize much with non-couples. And, while I do take opportunities when they are presented, being the third-wheel can become stale in itself.
Customarily, I would meet friends at work or school, neither of which have applied for many years. 
I thought about taking classes at the local community college or something but do I really want to pay for a class in a subject I could not possibly care less about just to socialize? The local schools offer literally nothing of interest (smaller city without a great deal of diversity).


I'm not lonely, just always alone. I think my work could only improve by being exposed to more social aspects in life.

The client and my company discussed renewal, but the sticking point became our hourly rate.

The client wanted us to lower our rate in exchange for a 12 month contract, but the initial price that we gave them was already, in my opinion, low.  

Anything lower than our current rate would risk our company not making money, or having to cut our employees salaries.

This resulted in negotiations stalling, and the client has informed us that they will be reallocating our work to someone else, but have asked for transition of all work to whoever is taking over.

The project was a somewhat open-ended optics/systems/software engineering project.  The product is currently in the design and implementation phase, so there is no final product from us.  This is not a fixed price contract.  There was no support agreement.  

Our only termination obligation under the contract is to transfer all currently generated materials (including source code, documentation, design documents, etc.) and all of the client owned/purchased hardware to the client.

This will certainly involve discussions and training on the code that has been currently written (which hasn't been fully documented due to time pressure, part of the task list going forward if renewal occurred was for all code to be properly documented).

Because the relationship (other than the renewal disagreement) was quite amicable and we really enjoyed working with the people and we enjoyed the work technically, we are prepared to offer some level of free transition service.

Our question is similar to this question, but we want to determine upfront how much free time we want to provide, instead of negotiating after the fact.

496,"I have done many website design and development as a freelancer and over time, I have my own set of ""business procedures"" to properly (or so I thought) determine project scope and budgets before signing of the contract. However, recently I was engaged by an interior designer and things got sour because we could not agree what phase we are in. So, I want to know and relearn: In web design and development industry, do you do the design before signing of contract so that you have a something to create your project baselines estimates, or do you design after signing the contract and accede to the client to experiment with different designs until satisfied?

TLDR;

I told him that as I understood in this case, the development phase starts when the contract is signed and from that point onwards, I should not be getting requests such as ""[looking at another website] Oh this looks nice! Can you make something like this and let us see?"". I explained that I can accept if he affirmed ""No! That is not what I agreed to, [this] is what I wanted!"", but I simply cannot create actual web pages one after another to let him choose and pick like shopping.

The interior designer insist that he knows better since he is in the design industry longer than I am (he is probably 15 years more senior at least). He maintains that the design phase comes after the signing of contract. He said he would sit with the client, go through several revisions, sign off the designs, before getting down to development phase. He also doubts me because he thinks it is not feasible to commit time and effort at the design phase without a contract.

The main source of confusion in this episode is a Design Intent document provided by the client. I normally come up with my draft designs before meeting the client but this time, they have done all the ""screenshots"" in the Design Intent with detailed text annotations. I thought I am supposed to follow the document, I even clarified my doubts extensively, but after signing the contract, they said it is ""for design intent only"" and anything can change!

The main problem I have with his practice is that I find that it is impossible to draw up the schedule and cost without first having a clear understanding of the scope. Therefore, the steps I normally take would be like this:


Client looks for me by word-of-mouth and asks ""How much do you charge?""
I ask for requirements such as nature of business, purpose
of website, target market, reference websites for look and feel and
functionality.
Client gets back to me with information and I decide
if I am capable to meet expectations. If I am not confident, I let
them know and decline the job, otherwise;
I will offer ""Can you let me come up with a/several designs and see if there is anything you like?"". This takes about 1 week and will usually include as many different page layout as practical and usually the more important pages like product, about, contact.
If he likes it, I will let him know a rough quote and then set up the first meeting with them to explain and agree on the design and also check if there are additional/hidden requirements. This meeting will usually uncover further functional requirements which I will add to the rough quote.
Finally, I return home and draw up the schedule and cost, using the design JPG (which is now final) as scope, and get the contract signed. 
During development, I normally do not accede to major change requests without additional charge especially if they affect schedule.

How to setup client ownership of domain name and hosting

In that question, the asker wanted to know how to make sure ownership of the domain/hosting is handed off to the client so that person wouldn't have to manage it indefinitely. I have a similar question:

I mostly work for organizations having at least one or two IT departments of their own. Oftentimes, they have their own servers. However, not all clients have their own infrastructure. For instance, let's picture the following client:


The client is a very small business or non-profit organisation, or is a standalone person
The client is non-technical
The client has no server infrastructure. 


In this case, if you create a Drupal/Wordpress/etc site using a panel, it will be fully managed after server downtime or hardware failure. It will just restart and work. The backups are taken care of by the hosting provider.

But what if, lets say, you'd rather use Django or Play Framework? This requires more complex tooling. For instance, I'll need the following items:


Console access, with sufficient privileges to set up the server. 
I'll need to take care of inittab setup, so the application restarts in case of trouble. I'll need to be root.


Questions:

When using something like Django or the Play Framework, will using something like inittab be enough to allow me to disengage from the client and not have to maintain the system? If I want to disengage, must I use a major panel created CMS or will the above plan work?

ask for more money for the entire project which would change the contract

avoid any and all ""gold-plating"" and build only the bare minimum to satisfy requirements

I had already done this on one of their devices as part of the contracted work (with the majority of the work being web design/development), and what I did last night was adding sending/receiving email capabilities to two more machines. Overall, the time spent doing this was one hour rounded.

Now, we don't have a formal contract for this kind of small support, but my customer asked me to send along the bill. As I see it, I have a few different options for how to approach the billing in this case (along with different lines of reason):


Free: They were good customers, it would add goodwill (which isn't really needed at this point; they're happy with my work), and it could be considered as part of the original contracted work.
Invoice for a percentage of my per-hour rate: I don't have any pricing models set up for a retainer rate or support work like this, and I didn't perform web design work. Therefore, how can I justifying charging the full rate to myself?
Invoice for full per-hour rate: At the end of the day, I used time that I would be spending on another customer's work, and I shouldn't be selling myself short.


In a case such as this, what would be the best way to handle pricing for minor support issues that are possibly unrelated to the original work?

536,"My wife, a violinist, used to play weddings where we used to live. She was plugged into the local network, and would sometimes be at bridal shows, paying their nominal charges to local vendors, because she would make it back in one wedding. She would arrange to play with as many musicians as the bride wanted, taking about a 25% cut of the extra price per musician.

Now we live in NYC. No strings musicians pay the exorbitant costs for a booth at the local bridal shows. My wife cut a special deal with one show, they gave her just a small table outside the entrance, which was plenty for her, but so recent that she hasn't played any weddings yet (these weddings could be a year or more out). 

The brides paid $25 a head to come to the show. My wife paid $200 for the table. We got about 60 or so brides' contact infos, with about half phone numbers. (I helped her solicit brides, next time we'll do better.)

Another big show is coming up that charges $75 per bride. Again, they have no other string musicians. They're offering have my wife to pay $1750 for a booth, exclusivity in her field (string instruments), and to have her play several times during the show. 

She doesn't need a booth. She isn't selling anything but herself. My opinion is that they should be paying my wife to play, not asking her to pay to play. Since I'm providing the funds to get her going in NYC, I've only agreed to let her pay $250. 

I asked her how badly she wants to be there on a scale of 1 to 10, and she told me 7. It seems to me that string musicians do not pay to play very frequently at these shows. I doubt they'll have someone else if my wife does not play. I wonder how ""High-end"" it can be if they have a DJ or rock band, I don't know that market well here, maybe they'll have them.

My main question  is, ""What's the value in this, and what should our negotiating position be?"" Obviously don't want to pay what they're asking. They don't seem to want to negotiate, but I'm thinking it's likely they'll accept her $250 offer at the last minute, rather than not have any strings at their event whatsoever.

They were impressed with her performance and resume, and asked her a week ago to start this Monday. They waited until Friday to give her a contract with lots of terms they didn't mention before (probably because they didn't want to scare her off). These previously unmentioned terms include:


""responsible for submitting copy of Professional Liability Insurance""
""agrees to provide and/or authorize a completed criminal record check""


They also gave her a yes/no availability form that lists from 11:00 to 8:00 every weekday, 9 to 5 on Saturdays, 12 to 5 on Sundays, whereas they had implied to her that most students were in school and would start around 3:00 pm, and explicitly told her she wouldn't work on Sundays.

I'm mostly concerned with the fact that they didn't even mention these things up front, and she finds out about them the weekend prior to starting. I think she should refuse to pay for these things on principle. I also think if she chooses not to get insurance, she should ignore that clause of the contract. 

Are their actions acceptable? Should she buy insurance for a very part-time gig paying $20 an hour that they seem to want to schedule her at any time of the week? Regarding scheduling, should she give them an availability schedule that has all the times she was expecting based on their verbal conversations?



Conclusion

She went in Monday, they quickly folded to her pushback verbally. However, she did sign it as it was, without striking through the disagreeable parts. They said they would not hold her to those parts, but they still might attempt to if they want to get rid of her. However, while we're principled, we don't have any desire to be litigious. If they want to get rid of her, she won't want to work with them regardless. Thanks for the answers, it certainly helped to get outside perspective.

Essentially I'll be able to charge rates of a Fiver an hour, and that would be a comfortable salary here.  The time difference is only 6 hours as well.

So far I'm thinking of signing up for PeoplePerHour (as that's based in the UK) and my options would be
- Have the flag set as Peru (because they have my IP address) but write ""UK EXPAT"" in my description
- login into PPH through a proxy so it looks like I'm in the UK (sounds dodgy!)
- send proof of my latest UK bank statements to PPH to make them change my location to UK (I'm still a UK resident with an active bank account)

Really though I would want people to see where I am so they can understand my pricing, while knowing that if they call me I will understand them completely (both in language terms and culturally!).

If yes, then you are free to charge clients, when, for example, you are preparing for the project, you are going to the loo, or when you are making a cup of espresso and etc.

If no, then it is expected that you only track time when you are working. And always stop when not.

Before now, I was only tracking time when I either write code or thinking over the architecture. Or whatever related to that. I did not track time when was getting ready for the work and so on.

I will track time when opening folders, running terminal,

A couple months ago, I was working for an event production company as a personal assistant and online brand manager. I was managing the company blog, Wordpress website, social media and basically anything else they needed done. I had two rates as an employe. My regular office rate was $11.50 per hour and $15.00 per hour for on-site event pay. About half of my time was spent in the office and the other half was mostly spent at events on the weekend. After a while, I decided to leave due to the the company's personal politics and I wanted to focus more on my own creative work. Plus, the pay was hard to live on.

So…my ex-boss now wants me to come back and work for her. She is overwhelmed and needs someone asap. This time I would be working from home on the online updates for the company site, blog, designing event programs, brochures, etc. They liked my work and like the fact that we worked together. She hasn't told me how much she is willing to pay but I don't expect it to be much since the hours will be only a few random hours a week. Knowing this company the hours will be sometimes more and sometimes less.

My goal is to have (generally) regular hours one day a week and be paid fairly. I would be on contract as a freelance designer so I have think about taxes. The main question I'm looking to get input on is how much would you charge for this type of arrangement? I definitely want to keep things regulated and simple. Again, I am new at this. I'd appreciate your input!

I have found myself in a situation where I am working on a project that I want to get out of.

A quick overview of my situation is that I underestimated the effort. Was also giving a good price before that fact. It was supposed to have a quick turn around but it has become clear that the client is still not 100% on what he wants. It looks to me as it will be open ended and will be next to impossible to extract profit from.

My client paid me the deposit up front along with the deposit for the first milestone, which admittedly was my mistake. I shouldn't have accepted the payment until milestone complete. There has been nothing in writing except a few emails. No formal contract. I have also carried out a nice chunk of work, which I am willing to write off.

So, to my question, what is the best way to cancel this project? Unfortunately, it will be difficult to met so it must be over telephone. I am thinking of opening with something along the lines of ""I cannot commit to doing this project any longer."" I'm unsure about how much of an explanation I need to give. I think I will say the delivery date is much further down the line than originally expect and no longer works for me. It is better to cancel now rather that both of us putting in more work and having complications down the line.

At this point I would normally walk away, but their project sounds cool, and I don't think it would be a huge time commitment to make their app.

So what are best practices for negotiating a fee paid in equity?

One method I've thought of would be to go ahead and bill at my hourly rate, and then convert that to equity at their current valuation. I guess I would have to determine whether I thought their valuation was BS or not, and maybe adjust my own rate accordingly.

Another method would be to just do the work for a fixed percentage of the company, but that has all the problems of a fixed bid contract, I would think, such as scope creep and me underestimating the time it would take.

577,"I agreed to work for a remote client (USA). He had almost no specs defined. Up to a point I kept asking questions to him to derive features but later he grew greedy and kept asking for more and more features.

We had set milestones during the project against which he paid me though. However his expectations grew too high for the amounts agreed later on, and that's the point the question of refunds emerged.

We exchanged very long emails wherein I tried to explain that I was already stretching myself to meet my ends, and I could only provide certain features  - agreed before the costs were finalized. Unless he revises the cost, I would be unable to deliver more.

In this whole process I lost trust that whatever features I am doing work for, I will not get paid for as well. Before 100% payment goal, I have committed all code and shared with him a month before.

Yet he is not well with it - despite code he is trying to find faults with it. As for bugs, he holds final say because I don't own as many hardware as him, and even if I fix things, it's up to him to spell out success / failure. I do not always get his feedback also, yet he keep disapproving my fixes.

I provided him with testable builds but he says code pushed doesn't compile by someone whom he has hired locally!!! I built everything from scratch for him, yet I am supposed to provide support to his team.

He is citing one of my very earlier emails wherein I had promised to deliver features on earlier date (not bug free off course but fully integrated) - the timelines delayed due to his insisting of more and more. As of today, I am not denying any delivery to him but I am not sure I will get paid, and I have taken other clients' work due to him being greedy. So I have suggested him to deliver things later, to which he doesn't agree.

Despite my delivery of features he is citing bugs and threatening to sue me.

Is lawsuit possible &amp; feasible given that:


I and him being in different country?
The total amount involved is $6K (total paid, hence max disputed)
I do not operate as a company but he does. I am self employed freelancer.
We do not have any written spec to start with except the wireframes were all provided by him. He didn't spell out the details. I asked as much as I could on skype chat but later on he became too much wanting, so I stopped. He kept thinking that it's my job to derive specs.

578,"I am working with a number of small clients that often request small changes, once every 2-4 months at least, and the constant task-switching of working 1 hour for this client and 2 hours for that client is not ideal. Invoicing and sometimes needing to follow up on late payments doesn't help either. There's more time wasted than I care for, and the late payments are especially infuriating.

To combat this, I am thinking of moving away from hourly work and offering mainly prepaid packages of hours. It could be a 5 hour, a 10 hour, and a 20 hour package plan. By buying in bulk, there would be a small discount, and bigger discount with more hours. When a package is paid for, it could be valid for let's say 3 months. 

I would sell this new way by mentioning the discount, higher quality of work, and priority service. I would also raise my hourly rate at the same time, making the packages seem a better deal.

After a package has been bought, I would keep the client updated on how many hours have been worked after each task.

If these small clients had more work to do, I would definitely try offering a day rate, but that may be too much for these clients.

a) would have a tiny or absolutely no budget and were trying to con me into free work (""this will look good in your portfolio"" or ""we will pay you a lot if this project turns out well, however we think a legal agreement is not necessary"")

b) were looking for a free consultant explaining basic internet business things to them, so they can teach themselves before finding a cheaper vendor.

However, they are planning on ending support in a few years, and there will be dozens of clients (each themselves a company) who still use this product because changing to something else will either be prohibitively expensive, or just not technically feasible.

My question is this: would it be legal for me to provide support, documentation, and software (all written 100% by me, with nothing copyrighted by my employer) to these former clients at a small fee, as long as I do it ""off the clock"" with my current employer (the same employer who originally provided support for the product)?

The customers are aware of the end of official support, so it would be clear to them that I am offering my services on the side, and not as a representative of my employer.

My chief concerns are whether this would get me fired if my employer found out, and whether I could face legal action.  I signed a non-compete agreement when I was hired, but I don't know if this counts as competition if I'm providing a service which the company explicitly no longer provides.

I understand it might be difficult to give accurate advice without knowing more about the product/employer, but I'm not comfortable naming anything here.  I appreciate any advice that can be offered in spite of that.

Update 1: For clarification, my current employer is the large company which created and previously supported the product.  They are discontinuing support because the product is about a decade old, and no longer has enough clients with enough problems for the project to remain profitable.

I'm currently using a Google doc to keep track of everything, but there has to be the equivalent of a project Extranet - but much smaller.

I'm not a huge fan of Basecamp, so I'm interested to find out what people use with clients.

More details/requirements:


to do list: calendar is less of a priority, but that to do list is a big part of what I'm looking for, and the ability to have categories and dependencies without getting into a Gantt chart or schedule
cost: ideally free or low cost (less than $20/month) - part of the reason why I'm not going to use Basecamp is that I can't justify the cost for such a small project for a small client
hosted: don't want to download anything and self-host, and don't need a specific app - a SaaS Web based solution is fine
collaborative: could be shared with another person (the client) privately
mood board: some sort of ability to have a visual repository of inspirations or links. This is a minor thing - I can just use Pinterest for that.


At this point, I'm not tackling the development part, but if there were checklists of things to start thinking about, that would be helpful too to have built in, although I know that's not likely to be prepopulated.

ZIP-Task says the organise projects in a more systematical way (especially by first installing a project manager) but still selecting team members from an open freelancer pool on demand.

That special company seems a bit weird. For potential freelancers they even do not provide an explicit way of contacting them (e.g. by e-mail) other then applying for their pool.

I have been thinking a lot lately that this is the kind of work I want to fill my day with. I am consistently guilty that I am not giving my current full time job my whole heart. I was planning to have a better exit strategy in place (budget, business plan, etc) and quit around May. But, emotions got the best of me and I put in my notice here a few days ago. Sometimes you gotta leap, and the timing with the additional work from the side gig just fit. I hope.

I have not yet told the side gig that I am preparing to work on their stuff full time. I don't want to put them in an awkward situation.

I have built a data management framework for my client. Gather data, organize, save to database, provide web portal so they can monitor the field, and notification system. The client is looking to add workorder management to the system. Automated workorder generation  would be triggered by unit shutdown (alarm condition) and the preventative maintenance schedule. The system would also include inventory management. Workorders would be manually added as well.

The client sent out the work scope last week. They had mentioned that the spouse of one of their employees could contribute to this project. We all met this morning and the spouse spoke of her idea of how to implement the system. 

Her system would involve building a java application that would be installed on each user's machine. Other option is a web interface written in java.

The existing application is a web-based interface built with Python &amp; Flask. MySQL is the database backend.

My concern is that we would both be working in completely different technological ecosystems, thereby providing the client essentially two completely disparate systems that logically should exist as one entity. 

I would like to provide the WO management as a section of our existing web application. For various reasons, it is intimately tied to the underlying database. Some refactoring of the schema is in order, but extending the existing application to provide this functionality seems like the best choice for a few reasons*. 

Obviously, I am trying to approach this pragmatically. I don't want to give the impression that I am pushing my offerings selfishly. I really don't want them to deal with two systems that perform the work of one. I see that as the source of headaches, costs, delays, more headaches.

The spouse already has a full time employment commitment. I have already told the client that I am available to devote primary effort to this project. I don't think that this is a case of ""lets throw some work to X as a favor"". I see the client as choosing what is best for their needs.

ADVANTAGES OF 1 vs 2 SYSTEMS: 1) The system is one system instead of two. 

2) It is an extension of the existing application.

3) consistency on the UI

4) web application does not require install. The user login system on the website is already in place. HTML5's WebStorage allows offline functionality to be incorporated. 

5) current system already interacts with the database.

6) Listing a site's current workorders would be easier, not requiring back and forth communication.

TL;DR
How to pragmatically show that incorporating a layer of isolated technology to solve a problem that could be solved by an extension of the client's existing technology is not ideal?

My plan is to formalize my proposal from a tech perspective and share it with all parties involved, and hope that it speaks for itself.

We do not have any kind of official contract and they do not provide me anything besides the hourly wage I make, however we talked that I should be able to work 40 hours a week at least, which means I can not just find a full time job here and work in the evenings for 3 - 4 hours a day. 

The work goes like this:
I work for an amount of hours everyday. I do the tasks assigned to me, as well as because I am responsible of quality and testing of the software product(s) they have, I have a constant responsibility which is to make sure the product is working well at all times.

But sometimes things will slow down, no development will be done there so the product will be in ""stable"" position, where testing the same thing over and over again will yield nothing and will be kind of frustrating and a ""waste of effort"". 

However my income solely depends on this work and even if there is not much to do, I sit in front of the computer every morning at 8:00 a.m. and sit at least for 6 - 8 hours and ""be available"" for them, even if I do not ""really"" do some work. 

At the end of the month I am supposed to report how many hours I have ""worked"" and what I have worked on, and depending on the hours they pay me.

For example, today I did not have much to do. All I did was to reply to 3 - 4 emails, test 2 issues that were fixed and fix 2 export templates that some customer uses. (Minor fixes in the layout etc..) I did some my usual, routine testing on the software as well but did not find any bugs or etc.. 

What am I supposed to do if this goes on for like a week or two? Do I still bill them for 6 hours a day? On one hand I think it is not fair to bill them because I am home and not really doing anything. However, on the other hand, I am not doing anything because there is really nothing to do. And I do not just go do my personal stuff like taking the car to the shop or going to the bank or going to doctors appointments etc. I am home 'available' for them, sitting right in front of the computer. I am testing the same things over and over again but I sometimes already know nothing is broken. 

Or is this the nature of this way of working, and should I just think like ""well today was a bad day, no work to do"" and not bill them at all, and if keeps going like this find a new job? I know they are happy with the work I am doing, when there is something to do so I am not sure if quitting is a solution for either for the sides.

I do not if this makes any difference I can say that the hourly wage I am getting is an amount that the company would pay an unqualified employee in Switzerland, but it is still a good amount for my country because of the Euro / Turkish Lira rate. So if they would hire someone to do the same job in Switzerland, they would probably be required to pay double what they were paying me. They do not provide me an office space, any food, any insurance or taxes etc, so having a remote employee is a win for them, and it is a win for me because I get to work from home and get paid well considering my countries situation, as long as there is work to do(?)

I did that, and didn't change anything else about the site.

Fast forward a week and now he forwards me a message from the host, presumably very much like the first one he got earlier (which he neglected to send me then), which explains his site was infected again through a vulnerable plugin. The email lists the file and line number that contains the exploit. This was frustrating to me because I have better (and better-paying - he's an old client on a ""legacy"" rate) things to do than deal with this guy's failure to communicate/understand the problems he creates for himself, again.

I would like to make this situation better for both of us by changing the nature of our relationship (at least for this site if not more) from hourly on-demand work to a monthly fee where I spend some time on a regular basis to prevent these kinds of problems before they happen by keeping things up to date, changing passwords, etc. This would ensure I get paid more regularly (and I can keep myself from wasting more hours by working intelligently to start with, rather than fixing stuff for him after he breaks it), and it would ensure his site doesn't keep getting screwed due to negligence/ignorance.

I am not sure how to bring this up however, and I feel like it's hard for him to take me seriously as a potential service (compared to a developer-on-demand like he sees me now). I said once already in an email that he needs to keep things up to date or problems will continue, and I could take care of that if he wanted. He did not acknowledge this statement but instead focused on the problem at hand and just asked how long it will take to fix. I am trying to come up with a more compelling way of explaining I no longer want to waste both of our time doing this hourly work fixing problems that should never exist in the first place if he had me handling things on an ongoing basis.

Find the first client
How to get the first job


and other similar questions. 

After that I decided to post this question here as I was without an answer. If you still find it as a duplicate, I will delete it. 

The situation is like this:There is an experienced contractor who has been living using sites like Elance, odesk, Freelancer, etc. He has a good reputation, dozens of clients and 50+ projects. He decided not to rely on these sites any more and pay them a percentage and decided to work outside of them instead. His other main reason is that his account was locked for the 5th time for 10 days just because he was hired by a suspicious client and these Services needed time to investigate if he's guilty or not. In the meantime he lost a couple of potential clients. (Who would work for the contractor with a locked account?) So his main reason is the locking of his account for any silly reason (others who read this may simply not want to pay service fees any more). 

But he lives in a poor region and that is why he chose to use these websites in the first place. Yet again, all his clients are individuals or small companies who do not have enough work for him to make a living from them. 

So what choices does he have now? Is it impossible for him (and other like him) to live without large services like those I mentioned above? Does he have to return to his ex company to have small salary and earn small extra part-time?

Is there anyone around who started working using these services and left them and made a living without them?

I've spoken to no fewer than 3 accounting firms - one huge international one here in Sweden and they say they're not allowed to advise on international tax laws, and two in the US who never bothered to reply to me after an initial back-and-forth.

I am resident in, and a citizen of Sweden. My primary source of income is freelance work - the vast majority of which is with US clients.

All I want to know is if I'm supposed to be paying tax in the US on my US-earned income (all my income is earned remotely, from Sweden - I've never set foot in the US). I just can't find a definitive answer to this. Some places say I should, and that any US declaration is deductible on my Swedish tax return due to a relief from double taxation clause in a SWE/US tax treaty.

Other places say that my obligation ends by simply providing a W8-BEN form to the US entity who hired me.

All I want to do is pay what I'm supposed to, to the right place but why does it have to be so damn complex? Would really appreciate any pointers in the right direction!

I have quite a few clients, and most of them usually only need an hour or two of work here and there. This means I get a lot of emails from different clients everyday.

What I currently do

Currently, to keep track of what tasks I still need to, I read the email and instructions, and then if I need to put it off til the end of the day or later in the week, I will mark the email as unread.

What I am looking for

I am wondering if there is a service or software I can hook into my Gmail (or similar) that allows me to mark tasks as complete, and possibly if I have replied or not.

However I already need to invoice one of my (overseas) clients as I already have a contract with them (which soon ends). The contract references me (as a freelancer rather than a company) so I have assumed that I'll have to initially register as a sole trader (at least for the duration of the contract), invoice my client and pay the relevant self assessment tax / NI contributions before (or besides) forming a limited company.

Is this correct?

And furthermore, is it be possible to register both as a sole trader and as an ltd director or do I have to 'cease' being a sole trader before forming an ltd?

This question applies only to those States where people have to pay income taxes to the State and where the States enforce a penalty on a lack of health insurance.

Some States, such as Massachusetts, had mandatory health insurance already before Obamacare made the requirement nationwide. People who opted not to get health insurance in MA have had to pay a penalty to the State with the income tax.

Because of this, is it possible that a freelancer without health insurance could (at least in MA) end up having to pay a lack-of-insurance penalty separately to both IRS and to the State they file their taxes in?

I'm willing to pay the designer for his collaboration (we'll probably use oDesk for that), but I'm also offering him partnership (we'll share any potential revenue the game might generate once released) for a couple reasons: 


I want the designer to consider the project as his own and give his best

However, they've said that if I take these actions, they will bill me for the total amount of the assets. They've also said that I would need to forward all completed work as per the NDA and the company's Terms and Conditions.

She was only a little way in when she ran into a road block: she didn't know how to make any forms work or incorporate e-commerce. That's when I stepped in, I completely made a new site from scratch, as there was no way I was going to improve her beginner coding techniques.

I worked on it a lot through the end of the year and then stopped in January only touching once in a while (I was busy). About early February once I had a handle on my course work I picked up the site I built my own basic CMS for their blog, event management, and online store products. I then incorporated Paypal and a few other things on the back end a few contact forms, and mapping. 

When I came onto do this I never had a contract/agreement for me being paid. This is a local coffee-shop with multiple locations and high income so they can afford to pay. Only problem is should I just let it go and use it as a portfolio booster or should I bring up the topic of compensation?  I've spent at least a good 25 hours of my time on it for the past 6-7 weeks and in December I was spend most of my free time on it. I spent most of my holiday finishing it.

The reason why I did not migrate 1.5 and 2.5 to 3.4 is because the owners didn't want to invest in rebuilding their websites from scratch due to high code customization or unaivailability of the components, etc.

I know that the website owners will notice a loss on the page views and anyway I want to be correct and inform them about that.

I also know that it will be a nightmare to make 1.5 and 2.5 version responsive also considering the components like ecommerce or flash flipping books.

Being a freelance and working alone, I feel I'll not be able to change all the sites for the 21th april, and I really don't have a strategy.

(Think about a Joomla 1.5 website with Virtuemart ecommerce and many other obsolete components that are NOT responsive ready). 

The main problem is that site owners never want to invest on their sites, they want to spend less possible and they never seem to understand the effort that takes even if I try to explain at best that I can.

I already know since now that the proposal to invest in rebuilding the website to a new modern performing version will be unacceptable to some client.

I sometimes work alone, sometimes as a team of 3. Either way, I have to keep track of all time that has already been booked and time that is available for new tasks.

So when the client asks me for something urgent or when we can start work, I usually take a day to calculate and then come back and update him.

So far, I did not have any negative consequences e.g. client left me in angry, but this is far from professional conduct.

It seems to me that a B-1 visa wouldn't be applicable in this case but I've heard people say that if you're providing your services via your own company then it's different. Am I missing something?

725,"I have been freelancing from home for about a year now. On the work side, things have been going very well; I am making good money and having a blast. On the personal side, however, things are getting strained with my girlfriend, who shares an apartment with me.

She knows that I am working and tries to take it seriously, but she seems to have trouble understanding why I need to stay focused on work for a full 8 hours, and can't wrap up the day early or frequently stop to see things she wants to show me, or ask for my opinion on an email she's working on. (She is not currently employed or in school, although she is working on rectifying those issues). I don't think she realizes how often she interrupts me, and she gets very upset when I start refusing to take a short break to do x. 

Sometimes I'll be working on a complex piece of code, or stuck on a difficult paragraph in an email to a client, and get very angry when I'm interrupted 3 or 4 times before I finish the task. Other times, she starts yelling when I underestimate how long it will take to finish up the last thing I'm doing (often an email summary of my work for the day) before I clock out.

I'm hoping to get advice from other freelancers who have gone through similar struggles at home. What is a good way to sit down and discuss this with her, and help her understand the importance of working with minimal distractions? Are there any good articles or resources I could encourage her to read? What can I do better to make her happy and not feel neglected or like she's always waiting for me?

Some of the things I've tried:


Telling her to think of it the same way as if I am at an office (doesn't work for her because I'm not at an office and I ""made that
choice"")
Telling her this is how I make my income and if I work less, I get paid less
Explain in detail how I get very frustrated and even angry when constantly interrupted while I'm working
Putting a Japanese divider between us (the cat mauled it in very short order; there goes a hundred bucks...)


We are living in a smallish apartment and there is no practical way for me to have a dedicated office space. I have one computer desk and it's where I do all of my business and non-business activities that require a computer. Her desk is right next to mine.

charge fixed cost of 25% x full time monthly price, and then charge regular hourly rate if there's any actual work or

For the first 4-5 weeks this was the plan except that designs and API were delayed.   Not a big deal.  At week 5 we were about 80% complete, and the client came back with drastically reduced business requirements that required redoing the product.  New designs were issued.  Work was started to implement this, reusing some of the previous work but still redoing design requirements. 

We're now at week 12, and newer revised documents are issued with further changes.  We hope to get them finalized in 2 weeks, but the target release is not for 4 weeks still.  The original 6 weeks of work are now discarded at this point, as things evolve.

As you can see, it is a project that has taken longer than expected.  The client's budget was pretty fixed and reasonable, but it has taken a longer duration of my time than expected.  Some of this is normal software iterative process, however redoing 3 times and constantly changing release plans is difficult.

Currently I am focusing on forming my own development company, and have landed quite a few clients of small to small-medium size.

Recently I was invited to consult with a local NPO on a project to replace an aging 10 year old software application for order and client management. To date, it will be the single largest project (if I win the bid) that I'll have won, so it's incredibly new territory for me, and a little daunting.

My questions are:


How does NPO pricing typically work? I understand most NPO's receive a discount on services, which is then tax deductible (I'm in Canada).
Without knowing more about the full scope of the project, what is the general market rate for such a project with an estimated lifespan of 10 or so years (it sounds like they make major investments and then stick with it for as long as they can).
I've been told that they would also want maintenance and ongoing support of the application tied into the contract, what value is fair to place on that?
Given past experience, my assumption is as follows: There will be a data migration from whatever database/datasource the existing application makes use of, which might include a complete overhaul of the data model.
There would also be back end engineering and front end UI/UX work as well as graphic design elements, and documentation would also need to be drafted (system documentation and user guide documentation) as well as training on how to use the new system.


I have my meeting with them this coming Saturday, so I want to be as prepared as possible should they have any questions or want to begin negotiations immediately (it sounds like there is significant urgency to needing this new solution).

About one month ago the client proposed that I work for their company on a more regular basis and asked about my availability and hourly fees. I answered specifying an hourly fee that is consistent with market prices (albeit on the lower end). At that point I had realized that I had been working way below my minimum acceptable rate, not earning even enough to cover my business expenses (because I thought I had no other choice, because this is how it goes if one wants to get work on these international internet platforms, because I thought I would need the reputation, etc.).

754,"Liability

How can clients expect small teams and individuals to be liable for a security breach when the news is filled with governments/corporations with huge ITSec budgets getting hacked?  We're just web developers not security experts, are bloggers expecting to do better than financial institutions and nab an ""unbreachable"" product?  On top of that here's no industry-wide standard to comprehensively cover all of web development so who gets to determine what's adequate and what's not?  



When Can I Start Working?

If 100% security is a myth (and it is), at what level of proficiency can a responsible developer make his services available?  70% of websites have significant vulnerabilities so the people that built those obviously weren't waiting around.  Learning to develop using OWASP's guide would be nice if their update was available.  At least then I could explicitly state the extent of protection my sevices offer while having a respected standard to vet against.  Assuming that was the case, would a disclaimer somewhere along the lines of ""I am not a security company"" and ""I can not be held liable for losses incurred due to a breach,"" be enough?   



Developer-Client Agreements That Include Maintenance

Some people say you should be held liable for a hack if you were contracted to maintain the site after it was finished.  I think this should only be the case if the breach occured due to a failure on your part to install security patches and updates in a timely manner.  To be blamed for any other 'attack vector' and I think you're being unreasonably expected to guard against every potential exploit out there (bringing us back to that 100% security myth).  And as far as responding to the breach, depending upon the scope of the problem, I think it makes less sense to assume that the average developer should be competent to handle it.  Seems even the security professionals are divided as to what proper protocol is.  And they're specialists.



3rd Parties

Looks like outsourcing the security for maintenance (monitoring, updates, recovery, etc.) and pre-release (testing) might be a good way to avoid liability.  Would I have to explicitly state something in the contract to shift responsibility?

It seems to get confusing when you talk about outsourcing other parts of the project, like the front-end.  Are sub-contractors you hire responsible for vulnerabilities on their end or will the whole project fall under you?  Depending on the answer how might one coordinate contracts between the client, 3rd party security, designer, and more in a comprehensive manner that addresses both security and liability?



Information That Would Be Helpful To Me

What would be helpful to me would be to get working examples of how other freelancers deal with these security/liability issues.  The specific wording of personal contracts along with any additional measures would be great.  Seems legalese is just about as bullet-proof as security so should I become an LLC or take out ""lawsuit insurance for developers"" (just found out that was a thing)?  Any knowledge or experience direct or indirect is appreciated and I'd be much obliged.  Nothing provided will be taken as legal advice.

One particularly cost conscious client has me submimt estimates that their CFO must approve before they have me do any little thing.  Right now I am working on an upgrade for them which has a flat fee.

So a few times, their in-house support staff has called me with questions.  Sometimes they are reporting bugs in my programming.  But sometimes the conversation turns to where I am giving them training and helping them troubleshoot things other than my software on their system.  Today I spent over an hour on the phone with them and 75% of that time was dedicated to fixing their mistakes/questions.

Now I am in a quandary.  Do I bill for this time?  I don't want to get the help desk people in trouble for using my services without getting it cleared in advance.  But I also don't feel it's fair to all my clients who happily spring for the maintenance agreement that I'm giving free support to a company that won't.

When people email me for stuff I always say ""that will be $x"" if it comes with a price.  But when I am on the phone with them, I felt too awkward to say ""By the way, I will bill for this time.""

When I have new clients I do say in my agreement that I'll bill for this type of thing but I am aware that the people picking the phone up and calling me are not necessarily in communication with the people signing my agreement.

Do any of you face this type of thing?  Do you assume they just assume you'll bill for your time?    Is it normal business to say ""by the way I'm billing for this"" or is that bad business etiquette?

Basically, I would start off with one of the most popular Linux distros at the moment, and create a couple of simple apps that seem to be highly wanted by the community. Once I'd created the software, I would release it for free to the community and allow them to continue their development.

Then, I would create a website where I would share a couple of ideas I have and allow the community to vote for which ideas should I focus on first, and listen to the feedback. I would consider both donations and free votes. Donations would have a higher impact on me of course, so the community could compete with each other to select which idea is needed the most.

Later on, I would expand to other distros and desktop environments and possibly even hire a small team to help me out.

Once I receive my first donations, I would upgrade my equipment (buy a new laptop, upgrade my Internet connection, make some small changes to my work environment) and then I would try to receive monthly donations so I could work full time on those ideas.

I would regularly blog about my ideas, share my progress (possibly even record videos or livestream as I code) and be constantly in contact with my donators.

Am I crazy for thinking that something like this could theoretically work? Am I missing something? If this project fails and I decide to do something else, would this look good on my resume? I mean, I would not really be employed in any company and I would not really consider this as a startup. It's just a quick way to make money and start my career as a software developer.

The wife seems to be an awesome individual, and she’s going back full time to university. She has a degree already in the field I need freelancer for (linguistic). Offering her some freelance projects would really help her since she cannot have a full time job anymore.

Where I’m stuck: I don’t know how to deal with the husband situation and with the last interactions we had, I’m also worried about my clients’ privacy and integrity; for example, just minutes after I introduced the first project to the wife (a project for her only), he sent me a private message about it and made fun about something regarding my client. I was a bit shocked because I don’t do this myself, and I don’t know if she shared the details with him or if he looked at our conversations. When I mentioned privacy, he kept coming back with all the ""but why why?"" and frankly it annoyed me to even have to explain this to him.

I’d like to deal with the wife as an individual and not have to worry about her unprofessional husband. I don’t know if I should be honest and tell her about this (my worries) or simply not hire her at all.

I'm quite new to freelancing so i'm wondering if anyone has any advice on what to do next, when I accepted the contract and received the deposit I had given the client an estimate of time that it would take to complete the project, I work hourly so I also gave them a total of what that would cost, however once I got into the project I actually realised that due to a lot of the previous code from other developers having errors/bugs in it, it increased the time to deliver and thus my hourly rate. 

At this point I stopped working on the project and took my newly calculated estimate to the client, they have told me the new estimate is out with their budget. I have then explained that I'm not willing to reduce my hourly rate or give a discount on my services, it just isn't worth it financially. After I explained all this, the client started asking me to give them another estimate, but with a different figure? I don't know if they're trying coax me into being within their budget or what they're trying to do.

Should I be suspicious that they could promise me my new estimate and not deliver all/any of it? considering they told me that it wasn't within their budget, i.e they don't have it to give.

During the first part, when I noticed that the project had bad code that I would need to fix, I spent the whole day documenting and looking into what parts I would change, I explained to the client that I wouldn't charge for those hours because I hadn't checked the code before I took on the project and thus it was my responsibility.

I ask him to sign the contract and for his PayPal to pay for the service. Turns out he used no tripod so the video is all shakey. You can hear this constant mouning as if he has breathing problems, maybe asthma. 100% of all comments online about the video is about the sickening moan.

On top of that, he didn't have a video camera. He was using a photographic camera with video recording capability. So all the videos have a shutter sound because he decided to take photos while recording video.

He messed up big time and I let him know. Now he doesn't want to get paid. However, he sent me 2/4 of the videos. I already have some online.

Search for a freelancer with plenty of time ahead of the event.

They own the domain name so they requested the transfer etc (it's their right).

That fact did not disturb me too much, they were not very important client, but today I found out that a bigger company, that was my client since 2008, from a day to another moved to a well known platform with an important website.

These web platforms offers nice, neat, responsive, full-featured templates for blogs, website, e-commerce, at a low monthly or yearly price, and you build the site with drag &amp; drop and filling some text areas.

I have worked inside this company and the people there are not web experts but still were able to open an account at this platform, build the site and request the domain transfer when ready.

I wonder if on the middle-long term, this means that web developers are going to be with no work to do. Since 20 years ago only highly specialized experts could do web development, then with time, things became easier and easier and now everyone with a small practice (and with tutorials offered in the platforms) is able to build a web site or an e-commerce easily as you open a blog account.

How do you deal with clients moving to these platforms? It could be an idea to ""tie"" them with a long term contract (like 5 years etc, even that is not resolutive because after 5 years the cliet still can go away)? 

You just let them go since it is their own right to move the domain and hosting where they like most?

Is web development going to die or be limited to the big tailored projects or only to big agencies? 

Update: I'm 100% able and experienced in the latest technologies in web development, responsivity, etc etc. The problem is not about not being up to date but I think the clients prefer to pay lower prices (impossible for freelancers) to have a full featured platform and 100% of control.

On this particular project, I was desperate for money and knew the people pretty well so I didn't push a contract on them and instead started working ASAP. I sent 3 logo mockups and got an approval on one, then made some slight changes and started on the rest of the project. 

The project was finished in 4 months, and 3 months later (after payment), I got a message saying that the logo was misspelled and they'd just noticed the typo on their business cards. I jumped into my files and noticed that the original logo I sent was misspelled, so all print materials/social media and websites had the typo. They are demanding that I give them money back or fix everything for free.

I corrected all the issues, re-did all print materials and website content within 15 hours. I feel really bad but they signed off on the logo and the business cards and the site and should have noticed. I know I'm partly responsible, but I feel that they are more so due to giving me approval on all these items.

798,"I'm a web application developer in the UK and am looking to start out in freelancing. I'm in the progress of writing up a Terms of Engagement (ToE) and am making some decisions about how best to structure project payments.

I plan to request a Requirements Analysis from clients, either writing it with them or asking them to produce one and then reviewing it together. My intention is that this will form the part of a written agreement, together with a pro-forma contract for the protection of both parties.

As part of the ToE I'd like to set out a payment approach and I am finding conflicting advice about the fairest way to do this. I like the idea of milestone payments since I imagine it will develop increasing trust as milestones are completed. Also, in the unlikely event something goes wrong in the relationship, the client will have taken X fraction of a project for X fraction of the cost, which seems fair. However, other folks suggest 30 day terms are common, which would put an unnecessary and lengthy delay in project progress.

Does anyone have experience with balancing these things? I should imagine smaller clients will just get on and pay so that a deliverable can be handed over, but is this a problem with larger clients? Is it wise for freelancers to insist on milestone payments, even if larger clients have a Finance Department policy of paying 30 days after invoice?

799,"My question is a sort of inverse of this one, where the OP asks whether a client may expect software tests as automatic deliverable in a software project. To me, that would imply a knowledgeable customer who knows that tests represent a percentage development cost that can help insulate against the surprise costs of regressions later on.

I'm looking to get started as a freelance developer, and I foresee the opposite problem. I think writing good software (unit/functional/etc) tests takes time, and since this is a substantial fraction of time spent it must be billed for. If we say that it takes 20% of a project's billable hours, clients may see this as an avoidable expense and ask for it to be removed from the schedule of work. For the freelance engineer, this may result in a loss of quality and a lower level of deployment confidence (neither of which are great if the freelancer is hired as a maintainer over the long term).

This answer suggests that the day rate should be high enough to effectively throw writing tests in for free. However, this may make estimates look uncompetitive, and I'd rather have the client know exactly what they're getting for their money. Thus, is it worth persuading clients of the value of this deliverable?

These terms have been established in a contract. I've been happy not to charge for the use of Part 1 because I get income from their development costs.

The owner of Company A has now said ""Hey we now want to set up Company B, and alter the existing code base and manage it ourselves. We will still be running Company A, which you can continue to develop for"". Company B is a completely separate limited company to Company A so as it stands I do not yet have a contract with them.

808,"I'm a web developer. I'm 19 years old. I've been working for a year as a contractor doing full-stack development for...$12. Yes. $12 an hour. I decided to take my destiny into my own hands and start a business. 

I immediately started building an amazing dynamic single page application for my portfolio with Angular, made my own logo, custom graphics, business cards, car magnets. I got my business license, all that jazz. 

I will say that I have had an interview for a job doing AngularJS development for 60k a year. It was at a large company, and I applied after my dad (a Flex/JS developer there) told me about the opening. I heard horror stories from my dad who was part of the interview process. I got an interview, prepared and prepared. When the day came, I blew the technical and administrative interviews out of the water. Solved problems presented to me in more than one way instead of just one, and sometimes in ways that stumped my interviewers. After being told frankly by the office manager that I was the best interview they had had, I was sent home. Why? I don't have a degree and the HR department couldn't justify hiring me anyway because my dad worked there. 

That was a long story, but I think it pertains to my issue. I'm not the best developer in the world, but I'm also a far cry from a terrible one. If I can out-interview college graduates, I think I have adequate coding skills to get started. 

Before even completing my portfolio, I had a client. It was a friend's friend who needed TWO websites for each of his businesses. I panicked a little. I was in a new situation when he asked how much. In my head, I thought about my empty portfolio, and blurted out $250 for both. 

I'm beating myself up inside right around now. These are TWO sites. Both of which need to be single page applications with scratch-built appointment-scheduling systems.

I made around $2,000 gross a month at the contracting job. Although I feel I'm a good developer, I can't bring myself to ask $100/hour. Because I've already quit my day job, I'm kind of at a loss here. 

I'm quite experienced with PHP, HTML, CSS, Vanilla JavaScript, and AngularJS. I'm moderate with SQL, and jQuery. (I could do both of those things, but I would have to look at the documentation a little more than the other languages.)

I'm familiar with, and can build dynamic single page applications with Angular, I'm at home with JSON and HTTP requests. 

That said, these two sites I'm working on now are the only two things I can claim as mine, and they're not even finished yet.

818,"I am considering starting out in IT freelancing by taking some day-rate contracts via recruiters. As I understand it, the recruiter is paid an additional fee for the duration of the contract, on an ongoing basis, based on the day rate. However there is no employment relationship and I would still be self-employed (probably as a limited company).

Most advertisements for work that I see specify a contract length in months, and they're usually 3, 6 or 12, sometimes with the possibility of extension. My understanding is that this is just a rough indication, and the client may terminate the relationship with no notice, since they are paying a higher rate for this flexibility (this could be because a project was cancelled, they've hired a permanent employee, or they are not satisfied with the work provided, or for whatever other reason).

I am interested in whether there are generally any legal barriers for the contractor to terminate the relationship in a similar way? Or, if this is not explicitly contractually prohibited, is it generally seen by recruiters as a breach of trust that might discourage them from working with such a contractor in the future? I expect that for long contracts, a recruiter stands to lose substantial sums of predicted future revenue if the contractor pulls out.

There are many reasons why a contractor may wish to terminate the work early - for example, as a remote worker, I am thinking that committing oneself to an onerous commute may turn out to be more exhausting than originally thought!

My understanding is that a recruiter will take a percentage of the day rate, calculated on the same frequency as the contractor, which is usually weekly. The client pays the recruiter, and the recruiter pays the contractor.

I have been told that since I have not contracted before, it is sensible to reduce my target day rate for reasons of 'competitiveness' (there are allegedly several agencies handling the same role). However, I am minded to think that the recruiter will not pass the savings onto the client unless I can check they have done so. I have asked one recruiter contact how this works, and he was rather non-specific and said that it's not his business area. I asked if the client was aware of the contractor day rate - I would rather they were - and he ""didn't know"" this either.

Do experienced contractors have an approach to check that they are not being exploited by a recruitment company, or is the best (and least satisfying) approach to decide my value and not worry further about it? Is it generally considered acceptable to discuss these figures with the client, given they would not be happy with recruiters inflating their cut either?

This means that I am keen to find out who the client is, and where their offices are located, at the soonest possible opportunity. I am aware that recruiters are worried that I will use this information to cut them out of the deal, though I have no plans to do so.

Today a recruiter asked me to send him an email agreeing that I would let his firm ""exclusively represent me in connection with the role"", and I did so, with the proviso that I agreed in connection with this round of hiring only:


  As per your request, I am happy to put in writing that your firm can exclusively represent me in connection with this round of hiring for the [title] role.


I used this wording (""with this round of hiring"") so that if I encounter the role naturally through another recruiter in a few months time, I shall have no legal or moral problems using the new recruiter. (Broadly speaking, I do not care who represents me).

Also I'm thinking my employer might lose this client because of me not proceeding but I need to get paid first, I have a family to feed. By the way, the system was worked by a different developer primarily and I just took over and my employer just got hold of the codes with which they don't have idea how to so I'm the one managing it at the moment and currently under my Git account.

Update

So my employer paid me already but it took more time than I have expected. It just takes patience and lots of it and had to remind them a couple of times. So lesson learned, make sure you are getting paid (at most) every fortnightly so if in case your employer won't be able to pay you at least the damage will be manageable to a minimum. Nevertheless, just be honest as much as possible with your dealings regardless if your boss is not. In the end it's not your loss but theirs.

I'm concerned fpgas are an increasingly niche device that will eventually get pushed out.

I can document the problem with freelancer.com .  I recently posted a job description for a wordpress/php development on freelancer.com .  Within a day I had about 50 bids.  Exciting.  Alas, reading the responses made me somewhat suspicious.  For one, I asked everyone who bid to try out an existing website I owned---and I can see how many actually tried it out.

So, I decided to post another job:

to have been quasi-automated spam.  so, to check who is just
responding without information, here is another request:

 should be easy in php and wordpress, right? if you respond to this
 one with a bid, obviously you must be reading my RFPs in great detail.

I am a programmer and i am trying to stick to working hours which leave space for a personal life, at least on the contracts. This means 7 net hours per day, times 5 days per week. If i would have to divide this among two clients, leaving one day per week for learning, networking and other work-related activities, the hours per week would be:


14 hours first client
14 hours second client
7 hours for other work related activities


If seven hours per day seems too few to you, consider that those are 7 logged hours, excluding everything but work, even picking calls or going to the toilet. In my experience and in the experience of some colleagues of mine, collecting up to even 7 net hours every day is not very common.

So, the problem is that 14 hours per week seem too few to me and i am afraid that i would not be able to be helpful for my clients, but if i go above this it becomes hard to have more than one client.

Do you think that is it possible to work professionally also with such an amount of hours per week? Does everyone change client every few months, or is there a way to actually divide week hours among different clients without giving up on your personal life?

Usually when I do freelance work, the price is negotiated prior to the start of work. But as I mentioned, originally this was just for my fiance to help manage the work load for him only so payment was not even required.

This is a complete project management system, CRM, Payroll (time sheet entry, management only), and billing system. This system is written from the ground up in .NET WEB, fully customized to fit this companies needs. Due to the nature of their business, a typical canned program would not work with out a lot of modifications.

The company is paying for the server hosting, and because this is a web based system there will need to be updates over time to account for Browser updates and code compliance, and added features (which they agreed to pay me for). So far I have about 150 hours of coding into this system with about another 20 hours prior to being finished. After talking with the owner of the company, they already want to add more features into this system.

847,"I am working on a huge, multifaceted application/service for a client which never seems to stop growing in size. For various reasons the client has decided they don't want anyone else to work on the project; so although I was originally hired only to develop a portion of the entire system, I am now stuck doing everything by myself.

Getting paid isn't an issue because I am billing the client hourly and they seem happy with the flexibility this gives them. However, they are adding new features to the requirements on a weekly basis, much faster than I can develop them, and there doesn't seem to be any end in sight. I have done my best to lock down the requirements but the client keeps thinking of new features they want as they develop the content that will go on the service. 

Months ago they mentioned several times that budget was an issue when considering hiring a second freelancer, but it hasn't come up since. We've already spent much more money than I assumed they had left, so I have no idea whether there is a danger that they'll run out of funding before everything is ready to go live.

My main concern is that the service will never get finished, or that by the time it gets finished it will be ready to blow over in the slightest breeze like a skyscraper of cards. I am finding myself increasingly unable to keep up with the scope - accidentally breaking features or even duplicating existing code that I forgot I wrote months ago.

Recently the client has been asking for endless analytics and views for their content. I can't imagine they will ever find any practical use for some of the data they are requesting or sorting features they want implemented. They've been changing the requirements for the content management interface so much I haven't been able to implement any of it, so it's not like they're using an existing system and realizing they need features that aren't there. They're just tacking on new features they think will be useful.


I've tried recommending they wait until the service is live and has a good deal of users before worrying about in-depth analytics (gently suggesting that all of the analytics in world are useless if the service isn't popular).
I've told them I do not specialize in some of the work they are having me do and am not the best person to do all of it; I've even told them this project is much too large for one person and they should hire a firm (they may not have the budget for a firm). 
I've suggested we hold off on some less-important features until the service goes live so we get something out the door faster
I've told them that if budget is a concern, it might be a good idea to prune some less-important features entirely

Very small project, mostly adding content to a CMS site.
Client happy with work, but now can't pay due to lack of funds.
After several months I informed the client that I would take the work down (leaving the site in the same state as prior to the work being commenced) until such time that I have been paid.
Client now believes that since I've 'taken the work back' that I shouldn't require payment and that the matter is closed.
The site is hosted in the UK, but not by me; I believe they are registered to a third-party. 


Specifically, can anyone point to any UK legislation regarding payments that might cover this scenario? Much of what I've found covers the right for a company to reclaim products/items, and I'm not having much luck finding out my rights with regards to claiming payment for a service. I know I can point to the contract etc; what I'm looking for is a 'such and such act of 1988' that says I can still expect to be paid even if website is taken down/changed. Nothing like pointing at an objective specific law to shut down a line of argument!

Invoices are only delivered once the job has been completed.

I never signed anything, just said it would be about $200. We never set a timetable, and the work was defined as, upload some blog posts, install and configure some plugins, change the navigation menu. All through email.

I did the majority of the work and then was asked to wait until their client finished creating their content. I waited and forgot about the project. Two months later I receive the content and was asked to put it up on the site. They also asked to me write a document on how to post content. I threw that in and asked if the project was considered complete.  They said yes. Before I could create an invoice, they came back asking questions about search engine analytics and if I could look at that account. I looked at it for them and they asked if I could add it to the site. I said yes and did. No additional fee's or monetary reimbursement was discussed for this update.The original bill has still never been produced.

It is possible that the  code injection was bungled. It looks like the script was accidentally placed inside another script - invalidating the data collection. I did test the analytics after, and it was working, but I don't know if this is an error that takes time to propagate. I also have no history of knowing who else was potentially editing files.

I was asked about the error rather bluntly, and because of previous stress related to communication with the project, I said if it was my fault I am sorry and I will forfeit the original bill and we can not work together again. I also said I would fix the error no matter their decision.

I haven't heard a response and I am really stressing that I made a fundamental error here and opened myself up to a lawsuit I can't afford. I am not even a freelancer, I was just referred from my employer to help these guys as they were looking to cut costs on the project...

852,"I find myself with the enviable problem of having more work than time, and as such, I'm attempting to steamline tasks and increase efficiency, along with raising my rates. One issue that has cropped up more and more frequently is client communication. I have about two dozen clients currently, with between 10-20 who are active in any given month (with billable hours) and a few who I only hear from once or twice a year for a quick fix or update. 

I've been at this a dozen years, and personal emails have always sufficed to communicate information effectively prior to now. However, there are times when  a mass email would be much more time-efficient than firing off two dozen similar emails, such as:


Letting clients know I'll be on vacation/unavailable
Informing them of big software updates, tech industry changes (mobilegeddon, etc), and new features available
Giving a heads-up on rate hikes


I currently have an almost-empty MailChimp list that I started because I felt like I should have one, and I've considered moving my client list there so I can communicate with them en masse. I can even personalize the emails by integrating it with my invoicing software to include their account information. 

However, is that too impersonal? Is moving to something like a CRM a better option for communicating with current clients? If you have a decent number of clients, how do you handle group communications? What I don't want to do is send out an email and BCC everyone. That's not my style and I personally dislike getting BCCed on emails, so I won't do it to anyone else.

854,"When I'm developing a website, the contract with my customer specifies that if I do something wrong, I'll fix it for free. That's the warranty for my work.

However, nothing is really free. If I'm working, I deserve to be paid. The warranty is just something to protect the customer from being over charged and that's fine. But, errors happens and if there is just a few errors, I want to put this risk in my final cost. How can I achieve that?

For example, let's say that I have to do a task and I estimate that I need 10 hours to complete it and I have set an hourly of $ 100. My costumers want a breakdown of my estimative and I have created one first just for myself:


Task1: understanding the problem - 2h
Task2: creating the solution - 6h 
Task3: documentation - 1h 
Task4: delivering the solution - 1h
Total: 10h


However, if I do something wrong, for example, I may need to work 4 hours for free to fix it.

So, I would like to charge for this work at least 12h to be fair with my customer and avoid working many hours for free. The question is: how can I show this to my customer if my contract says that I must disclose my estimates?

Option 1: add a taks for ""risk""


Task1: understanding the problem - 2h
Task2: creating the solution - 6h 
Task3: documentation - 1h 
Task4: delivering the solution - 1h
Task5: 20% of risk - 2h
Total: 12h


Problem: my customer don't want to pay for risk. He says that my hourly rate is too high and he is already paying for it. However, I never said that my hourly rate considers the risks of the job.

Option 2: raise my hourly rate in 20%

For example, if I charge $ 100, I need to charge $ 120. 

Problem: increasing the hourly rate is dangerous and I don't want to loose costumers for freelancers that charges a lower hourly rate but have charges much more hours than needed to complete a task.

Option 3: increase the estimates of each task to add a hidden risk


Task1: understanding the problem - 2h
Task2: creating the solution - 8h 
Task3: documentation - 1h 
Task4: delivering the solution - 1h
Total: 12h


Problem: raising the estimates of tasks have a downside: the customer will think that I have a low performance. I'm currently using this strategy, but my customer keeps complaining that I'm overly charging him saying that I need much more hours than I need to complete a task.

Now, my job is not about coding, it's about explaining to them why those files can't be modified, why they have to pay for a different host, and why I need their secure information so I can set up their paypal on the new site I create.

So I guess my question is, how do I explain these things to my clients? And in a polite manner? I feel like I've really backed myself into a corner here.

869,"So let me tell my backstory. After graduating college, a few months after, I found a work-from-home job through Craigslist. It was my first ever job. It paid $15/hr and I was supposed to get about 20 hours a week. Things went well for the first year.

In that time I was able to find another job that was basically the same (working from home) but they were paying me $20/hr. Fast forward and the ""manager"" from the first company leaves because the owner can't really afford him anymore. After he left things started going downhill.

Around my 1-year mark I asked for a raise and even told him I had another job that paid $20/hr. He was pretty miffed by it but raised my pay to $18/hr but pretty much told me I wouldn't get a raise for a long time.

Over the last year though I have gotten barely any hours, maybe 1 or 2 a week. He also NEVER pays me on time, which has always been twice a month on two certain days. I'm usually left begging for my pay and continually emailing. Several times I have waited a month for my paycheck.

Company B that does pay $20/hr is ran by a much nicer owner who does pay me on time, but the hours are horrible too and I can barely make $60 in a month.

I'm a freelance web designer and since my first job, things have been picking up for myself client-wise. For 2016 I'm rebranding myself and really focusing on my business. My rate with my clients is $40/hr but I really don't have enough clients to completely quit the company jobs, but I feel like I'm not being respected by the owner and not getting enough hours to even care.

I'm basically asking for advice. Do I quit those jobs and keep my pride? Or perhaps tell them that my business model has changed and my rate is $40/hr and is not negotiable? It's not like I'm working 20 hours a week anymore so if I were making $40/hr it would at least make those 1 or 2 hours worth it for me.

I also have a contract with Company A (the bad guy) but it was signed by the manager who left. It also states I will be paid twice a month, and that hasn't been met all the time, so the contract is null?

Sorry for the long post! I've been dealing with this for a while and wanted an outside perspective.

870,"A client has approached me with a rather unusual request.

Instead of hiring my services as a freelance web developer, they already got a small team working on their first product, they have decided to hire me as their project coordinator.

Since the client doesn't have the necessary knowledge to analyse the work being created by the small team in question, they have asked me to act as their project coordinator, meaning, my role would be to supervise this team's activity and make sure everything goes according to plan and that the team is creating a good product (in terms of code and style), and additionally, not being liable for any delay from the part of the small team.

I think this would be a good opportunity to learn a lot from a different perspective and ways to work and dealing with a team, and, since this would be my first time on this role, I would like to ask if any you fellow designers/developers would have any tips about it?

The point I am really struggling to get to a conclusion, is about the rate that should be charged in for performing such role.

Should it be less or more than my rate as a freelance web developer? — due to its responsibilities and managing more people than only myself?

NutCache: is free and a good option but no autobilling.

Originally we had to create 6 different revisions to the proposal because the client kept adding things. 

There is a clause in the proposal that says:

""We know from experience that fixed-price contracts are rarely beneficial to you, as they often limit you
to your earliest ideas. We don’t want to limit your ability to change your mind. The price at the
beginning of this contract is based on the length of time we estimate we’ll need to accomplish
everything you’ve told us you want to achieve, but we’re happy to be flexible. If you want to change
your mind or add anything new, that won’t be a problem as we’ll provide a separate estimate for that.""

They wanted to add a new section to the page that was not a part of the original design they gave me.

897,"Background

I am a designer with a previous background in software development, and I'm currently working on projects for two clients as well as side projects.  Both of the client projects are hourly.

One of the projects has a variable number of hours per week.  Some weeks, I will be close to full-time on this project and working evenings on the other one.  Other weeks, I will have just a few hours per week of work on this project.

Both the client and I have a background in development, and we are using a Scrum-like process - where we hold regular stand-up meetings (although we're not co-located) and answer the standard 3 questions: 


""What did you work on yesterday?""
""What are you working on today?"", and
""Are you blocked on anything?"".


I'm wondering about what to do about charging while I'm blocked and unable to do the next task.  

(For those unfamiliar with Scrum, imagine that you need direction from a client about what to do next.  You ask them a question and need to wait until you have heard back from them before you can resume work on the project.  This could take a few minutes, an hour, a day, or longer.)

What I usually do while blocked on a task

In a regular job with relatively the same number of work hours every week, I would continue to use the time to study technical skills.  (Some of my co-workers would have used this time for idle conversations or surfing the web.)  But now that I work independently, I also work on side projects to help the future of my business.

Since my other client's project needs to be done at certain (and different) times of the day, I could use this other time to study or to work on my side projects.


I believe it's unethical to charge clients while I work on side projects.  The value I generate from side projects would ultimately go to me rather than them, although my side projects were instrumental in helping me land one of these two clients.
Study time is more of a gray area, especially if it's for skills that I can use in their project.  But I'm not sure how to handle this when the project's hours per week are variable.


Is there an established best practice among freelancers for whether or not to charge for this blocked time?

I have finished a 1 year program at University in the subject of Web Development. I am currently on my first year on a 3 year program at University on the subject of becoming a Full-Stack Developer. I also have some experience from smaller freelancing job in the past.

When I am done with my studies I would like to freelance as a Web Developer. I need to work as freelancer since there is no work as a Web Developer where I live. After my studies I would need to charge at least $50/h (50% goes to taxes as a self-employed person in Sweden).

Since I already have a lot of experience, I only need to spend around 2-3 hours per day on my studies. I also have all the money I need for my living expenses as long as I'm at University. 

So I think I have a great opportunity to start my Freelancing Career now, since I both have the money I need for my living and around 8 hours free-time for the next 2.5 years.

I already have one client (rate $50/h) at UpWork who keeps coming back to me every now and then.

So, now I want to start freelancing, but not for the reason to make money,  for the reason to build up clients that keeps coming back. Once I finish at University, I will be able to ""just start freelancing"".

As I see it there is two ways to do this:


Start trying to fill my schedule with 10$/h work, and once it is filled higher the rate with 5$ and keep doing so until I reach 50$/h. So I at the same time build a lot of references and ""reviews"" at sites like UpWork.

Start trying to fill my schedule with $50/h work from the start, even if it does not fill up my schedule at the beginning.

My concern is that if I pay him via PayPal or BitCoin (or some such), it will trigger a flag in some database (because it's a troubled region of the world filled with terrorism), and if some of that money finds its way into some terrorist network (via him, whether intentionally or not), I can get in trouble (providing material support to enemies / terrorists, or some such). To add to the potential complications, I'm a permanent resident of the U.S. who intends to apply for citizenship next year.

Should I just forget about dealing with this person and find someone else in a more peaceful part of the world? Or should I go ahead and give this person work. If the latter, then how should I pay him (PayPal, BitCoin, etc.) so that I can stay above reproach? Any and all advice appreciated.

Up until recently, the editors I was working with were all asking me for quite distinct things and I never had any occasions where there were different people effectively asking me to do the same job. Recently, however, and perhaps unwisely, I've been picking up tasks from three different publications which all cover similar areas.

That worked out okay for me at first, but I've just had to turn down no less than three requests from my longest-running client on the basis that one of their competitors had got their first. I felt I had to work it on a first-come, first-served basis have already promised relevant articles to different editors. In all cases the editors had contacted me about the stories rather than the other way round.

I felt terrible about this, especially since I've been working with them for so long. They were very nice about it, but I can't help feel that my standing with them has gone down a notch or two and that it's something that'll be remembered next time there's freelance work going.

913,"I worked for a small / local web development company whose owner retired about 2 years ago. The previous business offered hosting services (which, set up years ago was done in a shared hosting environment) which I just carried on (I pay the host company for the shared hosting account and then I bill the clients yearly via Quickbook/invoices). 

Along the way there have been several issues with this set up and I'm considering either going to a reseller account (where clients have their own cPanels and billing via WHM) OR getting out of hosting all together.

One of my issues is most of my clients are... not really computer literate.  They would easily sign their domain names over to DOA or similar hinky practices. Many of them liked the 'small town, small business' approach my previous employer had (which did work 10+ years ago...but... things and times change).

Another issue along with this are website owner's who don't (for various reasons) keep their website scripts up to date and a website gets compromised (violated, hacked). It seems the consensus is that it must be 'my fault' since I am the hosting provider.  Currently my / the actual hosting company doesn't feel the same way (which leaves me holding the blame).

A third issue is that when I bill a client for their domain renewal or their hosting renewal they seem to be of the mindset that they can pay ME late and I won't disrupt their service. If I do, they get very agitated. They don't seem to understand that GoDaddy and the like will cut their service for non-payment up front too.

And my fourth issue, I really don't DESIRE to learn every detail about email and web servers (my last place of employment had a dedicated ColdFusion server and it was just... a life and soul sucking experience).  I want to spend my brain power being a better website developer.

So I'm trying to restructure what I do so that I can try to avoid the above mentioned drama, and more time actually doing web development work.

One of my 'shared' hosting accounts expires in January (with the ability to renew monthly while I sort this out).

In comes the reseller hosting packages. I was specifically thinking of either InMotion or HostGator (I'm already with them now). 

Part of me would love to be out of the hosting game, so that things like a hack (or misuse of WordPress) or general hosting service issues comes about I can charge for my time spent inquiring about the problem (just as if you take your computer into the computer shop).  Part of me wants to stay in because I am making about $3K a year on hosting, and for the most part it hasn't been bad (with the exception of a reason hack to one WP site that took down the others on the account - which I would assume would not be as easy in a reseller account where everyone has their own cPanel).

918,"I've developed software that manages invoices, products, customers, and sales. The price of the license is 3.500$ and can be used by three users only on Microsoft Windows operating system. After the first year, one must pay 30% yearly (a ratio that everybody use) for bug fixes and mail support (actually it costs 750$).

Now I'm rewriting the software, and will host it on the cloud. I know I can't ask 3.500$ for a license, so I'm going to ask a price per user per month. 

My reasoning is to have an annual revenue while the clients keep using my software: since there are (nearly) no bugs, I don't like the idea that clients continue to use it forever after only paying the initial 3.500$. Competitors with similar, but buggy, software charge their clients for yearly support.

Is there any ratio that I can apply to determine the price per user per month? If they get bug fixes, the same level of support, and all the advantages of a cloud service*, would it be fair to set the price at 20$/month x user? For example 750/3 users/12 month)? Should it be a lot less?

(* Cloud services offer automatic backup, nothing to install, automatic updates, access from mobile devices and any operating system)

Now, because of all these delays, the project has been dragged 1 and half years. My development costs are not fully paid by him and has by all means exceeded the final project cost. I am staring at a loss on a project which is not fully paid up and not sure how long will it drag. And I don't want to work anymore on that project. 

In such situation, to recover my cost, can I reskin the app and sell it to someone? Is that legal? There was no contract with the client about he owing the copyright of the code.

I remember a while ago somebody sent me a contract (in which case I was providing the service) they told me to use some online service specialised in digital signatures where I had to sign. It verified my identity etc. That client was in the USA. 

On the other side I have sent some documents to companies here in Germany (e.g. health insurance) where I only had to scan the document with my signature and email it, which is equivalent to this PDF.

I'm 22 years old and just finished university for graphic design. I was approached by a small business which wanted me to design them a logo, stationary and a website. I was only charging them $20/h NZD because it was under the table and my first client. Anyway I've finished everything, they're happy with the logo and stationary but not the website. They think the whole website needs re-designing. They only told me this a month after I finished, (once her husband started to get more involved with the deal). So I came up with another concept and sent them the wireframes for it, told them it would take roughly 50-60 hours. He sent a long email filled with analogies about flooring and how he wouldn't want his floor tiled twice, etc (it was an entertaining email). He left me with an ultimatum, do the re-design of the site for free or return the deposit he paid and walk away (after the hours already gone into it). I would LOVE to hear from other freelancers and hear what they would do in this situation as I'm new to this and can't tell if I'm in the wrong or not. An important piece of information to note is that I didn't send them the wireframes of the site in the beginning (which was a mistake I now know) but does this mistake really have this much of a repercussion? And yes from now on I will use a contract.

We decided that we want to own our own website to market our services but by doing so (as our services would be branded as our web domain) do we need to register as a business?

All of our communication with clients and services would be virtual and we are splitting profits equally  from our clients but none of us live in the same state (one of us is international) so setting up a business as partners seems odd as you typically register within your state.

Here is my situation: 

I am doing professional programming since 10 years. 

Before this i was programming too.

THE BIG PROBLEM building portfolio is that i don't have too many evidence of my work. I don't have 99% of my apps/websites. 

I have fortunately couple of screenshots of some websites/apps. 
The problem is that i wasn't doing archives of things. For example, during classes i did puzzle game and music editor. Later i bought new computer or disc broke - there were no backups. 

Another example - i did research and research work for big corporation. I get grade ""passed"" about this work - it was half year working. I get note to my index and that's all. With other even more curious projects, that i could show now - i don't have nor source code nor compiled apps. There is one screenshot of headline in newspaper and my picture that i am the author, but that's all... 

Yes, it's sad, currently if i realised that a few people will choose me because they actually WANT to see jobs. 

Later, i was working for around 10 companies in average half year on various terms. 

I sent to all companies letter in which i am pleasing to send some confirmation of my works. Only one company sent me this. It seems that i  have bad relations with these companies. I had terms that my work belongs to company. I made an iOS app - i don't know even in which name is published. I made an Android game - the same, don't know name and don't have source code. Even don't have iphone to create a new one app. Company gives hardware, then company takes. It's so sad now, because i did it all and i have experience, but people want to see working software, which belongs to company and they made my long nose. Another project i was working for 9 months as Architect and programmer. Actually boss said that he thanks me ( i was probably too expensive ) and in one day they disconnected me from repository, nor i can't show project to noone, because they sell it somewhere which is top secret. The same with other projects. 

Now, here is my question. 

How can i build my portfolio. Do i have to drive personally to each company and beg them to give my example of my work?All i have is couple screenshots, knowledge about project in my mind and for all projects i have papers with deals - terms and agreement. 
Can i scan these deals and show on portfolio - it's all evidence i have?
Is scanning deals and publishing to internet legal? I have two shelves of them.

950,"Recently I have created a personal website to help me in my effort to find more clients. The website already appears to attract clients (I have been contacted once through the contact form), but something odd is happening with it on Upwork. Since I started including a link to it in my cover letters, I'm getting fewer responses. That's not subjective - after about two weeks I have checked my stats on Upwork, and the stats for being viewed and interviewed have dropped severely. I don't think I have changed anything in my approach except the addition of an online resume, so I think it may be the cause. 

Here's a typical cover letter:


  Hello,
  
  I can help you with your app. I have over 4 years of programming
  experience. Most of it is web development experience, with PHP, MySQL
  and JavaScript.
  
  In my work, I always put the business interests at heart. The work I
  produce is of high quality, I take special care to minimize the number
  of bugs and polish the product to perfection. And I'm always trying to
  be responsive and cooperative and to write code that the others will
  find easy to maintain.
  
  You can find my expanded resume at (link redacted)
  
  If you are interested, let's have an interview, e.g. on Skype. I'd be
  happy to work with you.


The only thing that is different from my usual cover letters is the addition of a line with the link. So, could it be that the link to an online resume discourages the client? Why could it be so?

959,"I have a client who is constantly threatening legal action against me even though I don't think I have done much wrong. I have done EVERYTHING I possibly can to keep the client happy, but it is never enough. He blames me for late delivery even though the goal posts change all the time.

Basically, we started the project nearly 2 years ago and had a contract drew up which had a scope of work included. The key point here is that at this point the app was very simple. The contract stated that we ESTIMATED the project to take 6-8 months. It also stated that all time frames are estimates and timing is not of the essence. 

Since then the scope has changed DRAMATICALLY. I mean it is pretty much a different animal now. For some parts I have charged for these changes, but I must have done 100+ hours in free work just changing things to avoid confrontation. I feel he is just taking advantage now and getting anything he can, and is using threats to do it.

The changes that have been made and because they were made half way through a project have meant the whole process is backwards. Its a complicated project now and without being able to properly plan it has caused logic issues that have appeared. There are things neither me nor the client had thought about that have come up, yet we fix anyways.

I have said a few times that we expect to have a deliverable on a certain date, and have missed this a few times by a few days or so. This has been because one of these unforeseen issues. I still persist and get it fixed.

There have been times when the client went completely missing. 1 was 2 months! Others have included 1 or 2 week blocks. During which times I have had no choice but to move on to other work as he is not there to answer important questions allowing me to continue development. I have to feed my family after all and can't do that waiting weeks for him to come back to me.

He constantly asks for changes on the application and when I say no he will argue and argue and argue until eventually I normally just give in and do it to keep things calm. Before so, he will constantly threaten legal action, saying if we are still in dispute he will get a solicitor and they will deal with it. I don't think  he has any grounds but it is never nice to be in that conversation with a client. Sometimes tempers flare and I suggest he just go ahead and do it. He never does and just says he will do it at the end should we still be in dispute. 

When I send builds of the application, he sends a feedbag document. When I finish fixing the items on the list he comes back with a completely new document with completely new items (a lot of the time further changes), and then later blames me for late delivery. Naturally I am stunned. I don't understand it. In my head I am thinking 'why don't you first check against the list I just said was fixed. If another bug has appeared I will then fix it.' It makes the whole process drag on and on. I do my own testing but I can't catch everything of course.

The threats are coming thick and fast, and almost every week. He is still to this day trying to get us to change things and sending items that we 'apparently' agreed months and months ago on the phone. I don't recall ever agreeing to these things and there is no written evidence. Everything I have ever charged for is all in writing and documented. Even items I have done for free are all written. 

In recent months I have told him everything has to be in writing, as I was not being accused of lying after every phone call. It is the only way I can guarantee that can't happen. Simply don't talk to him on the phone.

My SLA contract with them, which lasted just for under a year, specifies it's a fixed term contract:


  This contract will be in effect until the end of the current financial year, February 29, 2016. It is anticipated that this contract will be renewed on an annual basis subject to agreement by both parties. 
  
  Key considerations will be delivery of satisfactory performance by
  XXX [me] and agreement with regards to compensation terms.
  
  In preparation for signing a new contract YYY's Executive Director [the client] will meet with xxx's principal [me] to review the previous year’s performance and to discuss future compensation terms.


However, this fixed term contract also has a provision that says:


  Contract Commencement, Revision &amp; Termination
  
  The term of this contract commences upon signing by both parties. Regardless of the contract end date, at any time either party has the right to give notice to end this contract 90 days from the date of notice. During the notice period XXX will be expected to deliver IT services and will continue to be paid as per the terms of this contract.




I was served notice to stop working on the project on February 8th, just weeks before the contract's expiry.  I was told they would pay me out for all of February (the last month of the contract), and that in addition to this, they would also pay me for an extra month if I agree to sign a two year non-solicitation agreement, a non-disclosure agreement and cooperate with a technical transition.

I did not receive a performance review, though I did receive promises to discuss negotiating a new contract.

However, because the notice period makes mention of the 90 days of notice, I sense that I should be entitled to at least 3 months of notice payout for the contract termination.

Based on the wording of this fixed term contract, do I have a legal right to demand 90 days of notice pay, even though my contract's termination is happening at the end its fixed term?



UPDATE:  Turns out they want me to sign a non-solicitation agreement, so I think the extra month of compensation pay is being offered because in Canada non-solicitation agreements are not enforceable unless something of value is provided in exchange for signing one.

However I'm not sure as to how they want to proceed regarding the rate. I'm very careful discussing the rate because I don't want to show the client that I'm most concerned with the pay than the work at hand. Also I'm not sure as how to approach this situation as this is my first time doing this kind of arrangement.

It is also worth mentioning that the client and I are from different countries, they are from US and I'm from the other side of the world. Also since they are the ones asking for a full time worker under my company it is understandably a transparent transaction, meaning they are aware that I'm not using anyone to do work under my name, they are well aware the someone is doing full time work for them.

EDIT
They specifically asked ""how much would it cost to hire a full time person under my company"". Sounds to me that they want a different rate for that person.

So now here are my questions:


What rate should I offer them? The job is fairly easy and can be done by anyone who is computer savvy. Is it fair to me and the client that I stick with the same price per hour? I'm afraid that I would lose them if I do stick with the same rate.  

Or should I just use my rate and just give a percentage of it to the person I'm hiring?
Should I let my employee communicate with the client directly? I'm afraid that they might remove me from the equation since I won't be doing much of the work and only supervise. 
Do you guys think I should modify the contract between me and the client and create another one for the person I'm going to hire?
Lastly, is it rude to ask about the rate we're going to use, either my rate or the newbie's rate? Or is it fine to be straight-forward with people from US?

However, I've also recently organized an LLC for software I plan to release in the near future. This work seems to fall under the umbrella of the kind of work I'd do in relation with my LLC, so it's at least plausible that I could instead act as a vendor and have the LLC ""do the work"", with myself on the payroll of the LLC. It's being taxed as a pass-through, so I won't get hit with any extra taxes.

I know basic syntax for quite a few languages but the only languages that I
would say I know (that I can build an application in) are (in order of 
proficiency) Java, html5-javascript and python and enough php to work with
wordpress. 

I have made a wordpress site for my school's
maths club which allows people to post articles and made sure that it was
responsive. And as for dektop programs, I have made a few things that I
occasionally use for myself but most of the time I just open python idle
to do something quickly and not save it. In terms of GUI I have made a few
simple (as in not 3d) games for both web and desktop. I have made a basic GUI code obfuscator and code deobfuscator- it is not perfect because I made it only work to the java way of indentation. I have also made a tool that allows a user to select a colour in an image and make it transparent- a feature not available in ms paint.

I was considering becoming a freelance web developer but am reconsidering 
since most people can (or think they can) make do with a free custom online 
website builder and I think that few would need what a freelance web developer can offer- or at least what one with my experience can offer.

Is freelance web developing not in demand anymore? If I am not very convinced
then I doubt potential clients would be either. I would like reasons so if
someone asks why they would need one, I can tell them the truth - whether it
is unsuitable for them or they need it.

What should I become, a freelance web developer or a freelance software 
developer? Ideally I want to take any opportunity (within reason) but what
should I market myself as?

Also, is it realistic for me to be able to make an income freelancing
while at uni considering my age and limited experience? How would I become 
either of them and is it realistic to think that I can make an income from 
it while at university and maybe even pay my student loans? I live in the UK

Context: web development for a bigcorp via an intermediary sole proprietor, specifically:
I have performed contract work for a Client (A), who was doing the sales &amp; PM, and sold it to bigcorp (B)
I've secured &amp; been providing the hosting for the resulting sites; we have an agreement with A, that we will bill this to client (B) on a regular basis
Despite my explicit requests, he haven't secured a written contract for hosting these
Client (A) goes silent for a year
As a result, there's now an outstanding 12 months of web hosting bills
I've tried: sending invoice (no response), have called him (elusive reply)
Site is serving ~300K requests per day; hosting costs are ~$3K per year; outstanding bill is ~$8K


What worries me here greatly, is that I have no contractual obligation (other than verbal agreement), nor current financial incentive to host these (and the bills keep coming). OTOH there is a 30% probability, that keeping this relationship might bring in additional revenue, which might include hosting costs for the above.

I (and only me) have full root access to the server; and also have email correspondence evidencing the above; options I have considered:


Getting a legal advisor, escalating collection from A via payment request, going down the small court route
Informing bigcorp(B) of outstanding payment; and if fails, pulling the plug.

993,"Context
I just started in the freelancing industry and decided to go with something rather easy: translation reviews and testing.

*EDIT* Q/A and Proofreading

My client, an indie video game developer, already went through a publisher to translate its game from Chinese to English. the publisher then recruited freelancer editors around the world to do the translations from English to other languages (Japanese, French, German,etc) and put them directly in contact with the development team.

I finally got in touch with the development team to do in-game testing and review, and fix mistakes that I may find.

However, after reviewing a big chunk of the dialogs (in my main language), I noticed that the person who did the editing job really didn't know what they were doing. Verb tenses are wrong nearly every time, sentences have the same layout as the original (weird syntax) and a lot of words look like they were translated using Google Translate (which change the whole meaning of the line).

Since it was intended to be a small reviewing and testing job at first, I negotiated with the project manager that the pay would be something else than money (mainly promotional stuff and some special rights in-game).

Seeing that mess, I went ahead and corrected a whole scene (around 25 dialog boxes or 60 sentences) and it took me around 4 hours to complete (there are about 150 scenes in the game). Using a spreadsheet, I left comments for the project manager so he could see what kind of mess it was.

He came back to me, saying he's most likely not gonna hire that editor anymore and instead asked me if I could fix everything.

Question: Should I charge the same amount for reviewing/testing as someone else did for editing? In that particular case, would the reviewing be counted as editing, since I'm editing 80% of the initial work.

I know freelancer editors charge with a price by word model, but I'm not quite sure how it would apply here.

I'm being asked for a quote, but there aren't really much information out there regarding reviews over a botched job done.

By way of backstory, the client is lobbying for a particular piece of legislation, and they need strong research to back up their point of view.  I accepted the contract to provide the economic analysis that demonstrates that the client's position is correct.  But there are two major problems that potentially make the project impossible.

1) In order to make a sufficiently strong case, detailed local economic data is needed.  But that data is not readily available, and I do not have the resources or capability to gather that data.

2) The client wants the study done with a particular methodology.  Over the course of my research, I have come to strongly suspect that the methodology is not valid and should not be used.

Yes, I know that this mess is largely my fault.  I should have not taken on the contract without being confident that I could deliver.  It's a complicated story.  But what really matters now is what to do about it.  I see several options.

1) Make a heroic effort to overcome the data quality issues.  I've tried, it's already a month late, and I'm getting pretty desperate.  But maybe there is an unturned stone somewhere.

2) Go to the client and frankly explain the problems.  I have questioned the methodology in the past and have been told that I am the one who fails to understand, which I think is possible but unlikely.

3) Deliver a report with poor data and a questionable methodology.  Yes, I know this happens all the time in public policy, and it's one of the reasons that politics is so dysfunctional.  I can't bear the thought of delivering a product I don't believe in.

My aim is always to code myself out of the picture by building sites that are very easy to manage by anyone.

To my mind the term ""developer"" implies developing something ie. building something, not repetitious webmaster / maintenance / content management - type tasks.

Is there a role or job description that implies a more basic level of website content management, somewhere above ""Content Manager"" because it probably requires at least HTML skills, which ""Content Manager"" alone doesn't explicitly require?

Some additional task requests that go along with this role: adding menu tabs, content images, slider images, shop products, audio and YouTube clips and pdfs. Basic page layout using WordPress with or without a page builder, setting up regular emailers.

One of the features he built out for us only half worked. Incorrect information was showing in the wrong spot (date showing under the time slot) and there was a missing button field... so essentially, we couldn't even use the feature he built out.

Due to a time constraint and the fact the feature wasn't being used at the time, the issue wasn't caught at launch. However, a few weeks later when we started using it we noticed the issue. I had contacted him explaining the situation and specifically asked if this will be billable or something that he would just fix for us (I have to approve all expenses by my boss first). He did not respond, but went ahead and did the work. I assumed (stupidly) that since he just went ahead and did the work, he was fixing it for free because he didn't deliver what we had originally asked for.

Flash forward, I received a bill for the hours he used to fix this issue and my boss is going ballistic, refusing to pay to fix something that turned out to be broken. I can understand that maybe the time lapse was out of range for fixes, but at the same time I specifically asked about hours before he started work. Is this something we need to pay for and how would you suggest I approach the situation? I understand his time was spent on the project, but the project was never technically approved.

Client facing application (iOS/Android Hybrid)
Store facing application (Web)
Admin facing application (Web)


I've never had a client that uses one of the applications I develop for direct profits. I am used to charging a fixed price for each project, but now that this person is using only my tool to make bank, I feel confused on what to charge. What I am saying is.. I could do this app for myself, put it online, and get some stores onboard.

I was thinking if (besides a fixed development price) I should charge him a % of the sales that are done through the app. Second option would be, charging him as an outsourced project for a fixed monthly price, or finally, Just charge the development and that's it.

What pricing model would you choose and why?

So far I have been using java for all my web applications, but in freelancing you would hardly get any enterprise level projects. Most of the projects would be small to medium sized ones. 

Since java being costly to host and slow to develop upon, I would want to switch to some other web framework(MEAN stack to be more precise) to be able to attract more clients.

It would be a very big decision but I am not sure how do I make the switch?

The challenges which I see are:


My profile has almost all projects on java so how do I present myself to prospect clients with MEAN stack projects?
Is it at all possible to gain expertise on MEAN stack(or other technology) after just getting started while doing projects?(Rather than take months to master the framework and start making money with it)
On java if my hourly rate is x then what percent of x should I charge on MEAN stack projects?

After attempts to resolve the problem, he is threatening to take legal action against me to recover the money which is roughly $3000 which was paid over the period of a couple of months via the freelancing platform's invoicing process.

No money was received upfront, work was undertaken via the freelancing platform and all aspects of billing including invoicing were automatically handled by the platform as well. We had no contract directly between the two of us, only through the platform itself.

TL;DR


The freelancing platform I am using has a period of time in which the company/freelance hirer can dispute any logged hours before payment is made (a week for employer to review, then funds are held for a little while longer)
Payments are not instant. They are held in escrow in-case the company/freelance hirer has a dispute.
Payments are based on hours logged through the application the freelance platform makes you use which screenshots your work and logs the hours automatically.
The client never filed a dispute against me, all payments were successfully made to me. There was never a dispute whilst the work was ongoing, at any stage.
The guy who hired me never attempted to file a complaint through the freelancing platform, even though the platform has a dispute resolution process which is great for both sides.
All complaints they have had, have been through email only.
We are both in the same country as one another, but different regions.


Can someone who hired me through a freelancing platform and agreed to their legal agreements, take legal action against me because they were not satisfied even though they made no attempt to file a dispute through the platform? I apologised they felt as though I didn't do a satisfactory job, but they've been so hostile and constantly holding over the prospect of legal action against me. I wanted to make it work, but the stress is too much.

My concern is they're in the same country as me which would make the possibility of them attempting legal action a lot easier. I know if they were in a different country, then the threat of a lawsuit wouldn't really mean much. Am I protected by the freelancing platform here? Am I also protected by the fact they never attempted to file a dispute through the platform?

I have a lot more leads that I just can't take on right now so most of them are being pit stopped ie. I can't take on any more clients right now but I'll add you to the waitlist if you're interested. 

I have 2 choices right now:


Hire a VA (Virtual Assistant) to take some of the workload off of me for my existing clients and new clients. 
Stop taking in new clients and risk losing good leads without gaining the equivalent back. 


I've worked with some VA's before but I've never done extensive work where they'd impact my overall clients and were usually the VA of a client that was able to do work in 1 area and give me more time to focus elsewhere. I digress. 

What should I consider with both options?

If I choose to hire a VA, how do I hire the right VA? I've heard many horror stories. 

If I don't take on any more clients how can I maintain current leads for 3-12 months and should I continue to try and gain more leads to cover ones that fall off the radar?

I read this stackexchange post on building up presence (among a couple of others), and one of the things that has been repeatedly mentioned is social media.  For a time I had a Twitter page that included quick, writing-oriented quips and questions designed to (hopefully) get people thinking about the need for my services, but without any consistent business, I began to lose both material and inspiration.  Additionally, I have a day job, so I have a bit more pressure regarding the time I can give to my business, unlike pure entrepreneurs (I have to make sure I maintain what pay the bills!).  My question is, do I really need these outlets, and what would I post...particularly on a social-media platform like Facebook which calls for more extensive, detailed postings?  In my position, do I need these outlets?

I just thought I'd ask; I'm not sure if/how social media would help at this point.  Thank you for trying to help in advance.

1057,"Situation: Year 2013. There is this small-medium size manufacture company ""C"" who has a malfunctional website, infected with malware and viruses, if you seach the company name you get thousands results with online pharmacy etc. 
C is very unhappy and the original developers are ignoring C's requests to solve problems, so they started to look for some other solution, then they knew about me because C's owners are somehow my wife's relatives.

I was not very happy at first because is always a problem to work for friends and relatives but they insisted so I wanted to see and get a better idea.

We met and they told me somewhat like ""I would like that you will become like an internal freelance in our company so that you will be able to know us better and advise us better to what is best for us and for the C's success. You shall, with time, be able to operate on the site and socials in autonomy once you will know better the company from the inside"".

Year 2014-15. In this time I took C's website, moved host, domain and email, set-up top-level hosting services which worked great, I spent several hours at their offices for set-ups and configurations. Rebuilt a new responsive fully-functional multi-language CMS with impact design and lot of features for clients, reserved areas for dealers, custom PHP web apps (back-end and front-end). We made production videos, photos and other interesting materials. Set-up newsletter system, facebook, twitter and instagram accounts, managed posts and blogs, eventually made remote and on-site technical assistance, etc.

The result was very good and satisfactory, I made a lot of effort and C's has now a well launched website and social presence. The visits increased a lot and they built a good number of registered users.

Everyone is satisfied, web and social are working very good, regular payments, and so on.

Year 2016 first months: C's communications with me became strangely silent all of a sudden, my proposals by email were unanswered, very little were asked to me to do. 
Spring 2016: They asked me if I could send them the original photos and videos we made before, they asked me administration rights to edit social channels, etc. I understood that there was something strange going on.

So I requested a meeting with them to clear the situation. After about 10 days we met and what they told me is that: one of the biggest C's supplier provided a ""service pack"" to C that includes, togheter with various trade fairs services, a 6 months consultancy service for print, social and web marketing provided by the supplier's favourite web agency (""W"") consisting in about 10 employees doing various specialized tasks, and C took advantage of this ""service pack"".

I found myself in the unpleasant situation to be downgraded from main consultant and project manager to simple executor of other's requests. In fact shortly after the meeting I started to receive emails by someone from W with very demanding requests asking me for complex tasks in short time, sending me pdf mockups of web pages to reproduce exactly in an already existing CMS with high-quality responsive well running template, newsletter mockups with complex print-style format graphics to make as responsive newsletters (unsupported by most clients), and so on. W is never happy and ask me always for ""fixing"" this and that by email to me and with CC to the C's CEO. 

W even started to ask me for things that are objectively and technically wrong and counter-productive (I started to think that W wants to put me intentionally in a bad light so they can steal the client to me with the reasons that I do ""wrong things"" since C's CEO has no technical knowledge).

When that happened I stopped to do anything and requested a new meeting with C's CEO before doing anything else, I proved to him why W's requests were wrong with facts, examples and techical documentation, we agreed to finish some tasks in certain (proper) ways as I explained to him and I did so. I also told him that surely, being a single freelance, I can't physically do what 10 employees can, and if he needs another kind of service he is free to obtain it and this also OK for me, but if he wants me to work for him, I want to work as I know and as I think is best (having 20+ years of experience) without other people to instruct me or giving me orders out of the blue.

Meanwhile I found out that when W started to manage C's social channels, W bought thousands of fake likes to show that their work produce results, that question was faced with C's CEO at the beginning and he did not want fake likes, he wanted genuine likes. In the meantime Google Analytics shows that the site is losing traffic by 15%/month for the last 3-4 months (when W started to work for C).

Now we are in a suspended situation, C is still making W work for them while none of C or W are asking for new tasks or jobs or contacting me for anything. 

I don't know exactly how to go on with C, I feel frustrated and demotivated, they called me when the ship was sinking, then with two years of work I made it beautiful, functional and going, and then someone (without even asking me anything) told me to go to do the laundry while someone else will pilot the ship.  

Also the fact that C's CEO is my wife's relative is a big complication for family/work relationships.

What whould you do in my situation? Any suggestion is greatly appreciated.

Edit: just to clear a few things, this is not my only client. I have many clients with long term work relationships. C is one of my clients.  Losing it won't cause me a big problem. Also I was very collaborative, kind and professional at my best with W, I gave all the info, materials and hours of my work days to make W comfortable with everything.

1067,"I have been working in the web design &amp; development field since 1995 and during the years I have been working as apprentice, then employee in big internet provider, founder of small company then evolved to bigger company, then back to single freelance working in home office, now still freelancing with the help of different other freelancers collegues (we help each other in our different specialisation). 

I have been in all kind of situation from super modern agencies office in business areas, to cubicle, to garage, to average office, to home office, etc.

Since I work at home office (or similar situation) I always had to deal with the problem of being considered ""cheap"" by clients, I mean the place where you receive the clients seems affecting their perception of ""how much expensive you can be"", if you are in a sleek bright modern office (possibly in a business area or nice building), you can easily ask a lot more and it is all ok. If you (same person with same skills) work in a confortable and well kept, clean, functional home office with average furniture and desks, the clients usually expect you to be ""cheap"" and have low rates, just because you are at home.

I know of a freelance web designer (in another close city) who got an office in an attic on the main square of the city, who decorated the office with expensive paintings and sculptures, modern sleek glass furniture, large monitors a**le computers all over the office, etc, intentionally for the purpose to impress the clients and apply higher rates. This professional told to someone I know personally: ""People who are looking for cheap work don't even enter here"".

Now, the ""funny"" part is that for two times in the last years I had to recover/rebuild web projects that this above said professional made (actually he doesen't really develop, he makes young apprentices work and develop for him then he send them away after the stage finish). The sites were made with Wordpress, with commercial templates with minimal personalisation, published and abandoned forever, when I was asked to rebuild these sites they were completely hacked and infected with malware and viruses and this ""professional"" refused to fix the problem or even he told to the client ""I will notify the problem to Google and they will solve it"", which is a mockery since Google can't care less if your site is hacked of infected (I guess he just doesen't know what to do).

The ""shock"" was when I knew of his rates that are at least 3 times mine! In one case I knew he billed something like $1200 for something that I would happily bill $400. Am I stupid or the other is taking advantage of people technical ignorance?

I always focused myself on the work quality, to be a reliable person and polite worker, but it's hard to make new clients undestand that, and I always have to pull on the prices, vice-versa this above said professional seems to be attracting a lot of clients happy to pay high bills to have something that every freelance could do for 1/2 or 1/3 of the price. Somehow he built a reputation of someone who is above the others but it is not true (or he could be even worse to be honest).

Joe's Pizza owes me about $10,000, which is roughly 1/7th of what I'm getting as a yearly salary at my new job.  That debt in various outstanding invoices is much more money than I wanted to rack up over the 6 years I worked with Joe's Pizza, but it happened piece by piece, $500 invoice by $500 invoice.  I actually liked the work, and the people, and didn't have many other work prospects at the time, so I continued working for them despite failures to pay.

After 6 months of no work for Joe's Pizza, and no further payment against that $10,000, I finally got a full-time salaried job instead.  Now I work at a tech startup, the job is great, and they pay me a consistent salary.  I told Joe's Pizza that I got a full-time job, and thus was no longer available to work on their problems.

At that point, the CEO of Joe's Pizza, let's call them Joe, who I'm still on friendly terms with, got back to me and said ""I want to chat about getting the new developer I want to chat about finalizing access to the back end for our new coder""  I initially responded ""That process is generally more complicated than you seem to think, and you owe me a lot of money, so I would only be able to do that accompanied by payment"".

Now, a week later, Joe wants to have a phone meeting ""to finalize the back-end access for the new developer"".


They may or may not be able to transition to another developer without me being involved at all.  I'm sure it will be much harder for them and much harder for the new developer to have no assistance in the transition.
For instance, I'm the only one with ssh key access to the server.  I have all the passwords for the host, the email service, github, etc etc.
They certainly own the servers and source code, but I have little interest in providing work for free or for peanuts to give their next developer access while they still owe me money. I'm not wealthy enough that I can even afford to take effort &amp; energy away from my current, paying job to provide free transition work for them, either (in part because of lots of outstanding invoices).

Result: A day wasted waiting and keeping myself available for this task, which could have been used gainfully otherwise. Also, I have other commitments set up for subsequent days, and if this person now decides he wants the work done after all, I'll again have to decline him.


On the one hand, it could be that he is just under time pressure and while the change in commitments is unfortunate, future opportunities may make up for it - if I do not go and burn bridges.
On the other hand, I have begun questioning if this person (and his motives) are for real. Is this perhaps some elaborate game? Does this person perhaps suffer from delusions of grandeur about his plans - or perhaps some other abnormality? If so, it would be better to cut my losses and avoid being pulled in any further. (Although I am at the same time afraid that declining this person permanently might also affect my relationship with his spouse, although ideally and professionally it should not, although we are not in an ideal world.)
And on the third hand, it seems that his style of communicating verbally and very generally (perhaps a result of time pressure?), without vital specifics, versus me needing details, preferably in writing, is bound to cause misunderstanding/resentment sooner or later.

As Peter's and keshlam's answers point out, an up-front contract goes a great length to help here. I agree, except that for tasks that may take max 4 hours, and perhaps are needed in a rush, this might be a bit of an overkill. I have done such small tasks for others in the past without much more than a verbal agreement. In the end I am more worried about reputation (customer stasifaction) than the money or time, as the former is largely a mental construct, that therefore scales more easily to larger projects (where the money may be better).

Sending physical copies through the post costs money and time, so that isn't ideal.

As far as I'm aware, (generally speaking, of course this will depend on location. I'm in the UK, for example) a verbal agreement is as legal as a written one, as long as you can prove the agreement took place. So...

Is a simple email reply to the sending of the contract saying ""I agree, please proceed"" enough for the contract to be assumed agreed on? Does the client need to print the contract, physically sign then scan and return a digital copy? Do we need to use a third-party service such as DocuSign?

1088,"I'd like to get some experienced freelancers' thoughts on this...

Recently I've found the amount of work coming in running very low, to the point where I've been having to consider taking at least a part time job again.

My regular, well-paying clients are either away, don't have any work, or are cutting back, so I'm now only being approached by first-time potential customers.

There's a pattern emerging: they get in touch, get really excited about my work, tell me what they are looking for, and I give them a quotation based on this, and a fair rate for my expertise. 

Then I either get a ""sorry, it's too expensive.."" reply, or never hear from them again.

Now I know that I'm not cheap, but I'm nowhere near as expensive as an agency or even some other freelancers I know. It seems that I have a choice, either to drop my prices to get at least some work (although I'd be earning well below a decent wage, barely enough to live on) or not get any work at all, do some amazing stuff for my portfolio, and delve deeper into my savings and overdraft in hope of better times.

Should I drop my prices to a (IMO) ridiculously low rate just to get the work and bulk out my portfolio?

1090,"I run my own small business - basically building websites. I am always on the lookout for side projects, where I build and manage a site and the other person brings something equally valueable to the table (marketing or access to information or unique access to products to sell etc). These are done on a 50:50 profit share.

Recently someone approached me with a great idea for a site, but involved massive amounts of up front work, as it would have been a particularly complicated idea to implement. We had met to discuss the agreement, 50:50 was agreed, we set out a basic plan and the other party said he would put the agreement in writing for us to sign.

When the agreement arrived, it said initially it would be a 0:100 split, where I would have 0, until the site as planned was up and running. Clearly annoyed by this we spoke again and he said it was because he wanted to protect his idea, and that previously a developer had committed to it and then dropped out. He apologized and said he didn't want to be a 'dick' about it but it would end up 50:50 if everything went to plan. I questioned who would decide when that happened, and that basically he wanted me to work for free, with no ownership, on the basis he might be pleased and some day give me the 50%. I also explained that this is not what we discussed.

Clearly the project never went ahead. I could no longer trust the person.

My question is, after a long winded explanation, is, was he right to want to protect his idea? Did he have a point, or was he just being unreasonable. How should I proceed in a given situation and does anyone know of any resources for the sort of agreement we should be using for such a project.

I know this is an opinion based question, I hope I don't get penalized for that. But any opinions would be very warmly welcomed.

1104,"EDIT: Move on, this was a stupid question. Don't let a client's relationship to another client's get in your way: be clear, and direct, as usual especially regarding getting paid. And don't ask stupid questions if you want rep :(

So, I was commissioned to help fix a residential network - someone paying for cable, phone, and internet had issues with using the phone and internet at the same time. (No, it's not dial-up, its cable! haha)

Anyway, the ISP in question really dropped the ball. The client was supposed to have a tech show up to replace the modem - twice the tech was no call, no show. Client reports this, and is told he can go get the modem himself. He asks me to take out the modem, go get the new modem, set it up ... he would rather pay me than pay the ISP for the work they didn't do. When swapping the equipment, the ISP literally had nothing to say about the no shows. They didn't ask any information, just took the modem, and sent me off. I asked about hooking it up (I already knew how, wanted to test their knowledge) and they handed me a pamphlet and (incorrectly) said ""plug it in and wait 15 minutes and you're done"". Pamphlet, and experience, says otherwise.

Well, the modem wasn't the issue. Old one worked same as new one. The issue is that for whatever reason, these modems only allow one phone line in. Any more, and the modem resets periodically, and resets when line 2 rings. So with line 1, he can manage, but this leaves a sour taste in both of our mouths. This is all the ISP would have done, and charged him for it, but they didn't show, or care.

So I was able to solve the issue, on his dime, and (somewhat) understandably, he has asked me if I could seek payment from the ISP. Not demanded it, mind you, just asked if there was any way... so I politely tell him, unfortunately you still owe me for services rendered, and would have to seek compensation for the bill from his ISP.

I could have lied at this point, said just call them they will repay you, I'll take your credit card and run it please. But I want to be a trusted consultant, so I tell him: ""I'm not sure how to go about this off the top of my head. I'm sure they won't listen to me, some freelancer. But I'm not sure what to tell you to say, beyond the obvious fact that you and I just did their job for them, on your dime.""

I did what I thought I should do: gave him a grace period so we could both try and get payment from the real culprit. Left him an invoice due in a week, and told him that I would ask a trusted friend (stackoverflow is that friend :D) about the issue. I would LOVE the chance to stick someone at this ISP with the bill. They have caused me and my clients nothing but grief. Fixing phone issues is NOT what I had in mind for winning bread! Plus, this guy is well connected to a client of mine, so I'd like to be as much of a champion as I can, and not just another bill because the ISP stinks. 

I think there is a snowballs chance in hell this guy could get refunded for the money. I think there is even less chance there is anything I can say or do about it directly, or else I would go back to the shop that I got the modem from with the invoice addressed to the ISP. But whatever advice I can give my client that will get him refunded would be fine. I guess I'm looking for a way to provide that extra level of service, the warm fuzzy feeling - plus, fixing something for a client for free almost certainly guarantees a stellar recommendation!

1105,"I have an open source project. A client contracted me to, among other things, develop new features in my project.

1106,"I'm making a desktop app for my best friend's family restaurant (no, I'm not doing it for free).

Background info:

My friend told me he tried with several apps he found on the Internet; in fact, he claims they have worked fine for him (""by fine,"" meaning no bugs or crashes, the new meals are added, the bills are calculated with the right amount, etc.), but are very graphical unattractive at best, hideous and trying to leave you blind at worst (who thinks mixing yellow and red is a good idea for a GUI?), and lacking in features we wants / having features he doesn't need, so he figured he needed the app made for him.

Example: Someone and his/her buddies go to have their meal. He gives them the bill and cue some jerk in the group with a sattisfied sneer on his/her face: ""Oh, didn't we mention everyone is paying for their own stuff?"", while the others snicker. They have previously said X friend was paying for it all, and this... gaslighting starts about how they hadn't said that, how my friend has a ""bad memory and shouldn't be a waiter"", etc then he has to go back to the computer and do it over (and then the guys whine he took too much time to bill them, and start demanding a ""discount"" for the long wait.)
This happens all the time. Resourcing to ask them about who is paying what at the very beginning doesn't work either; they lie.

The feature he urgently wants is to quickly separate bills (now, he deletes the order and does several bills for each jerk, which takes its time), to stop these bully people for causing trouble and complaining for his tardiness.

Now, he's a role model user. Excellent, in fact. If he has a question, he asks. If he doesn't like something, he says it. He didn't understand why stuff is rendered ""inactive"" rather than be deleted; I explained it to him and: ""Oh, I see. It would be too complex given those relationships you mentioned.""

The problem both my friend and I are dealing with:

The one causing issues is HIS SISTER. She's one of those ""I can't do anything wrong / I'm always right / It's never my fault"" people. Whenever the parents (the owners of the restaurant) leave her in charge of using the computer and adding data to the current app, bad stuff happens. Whenever my friend comes with a new order, she goes to the kitchen and tells the chef what to cook, but she forgets to add the order into the system! By the end of day, they have counted their winnings in $ X, but the system says is $ Z. Well, duh!
SOMEONE didn't go their job! When she's confronted by the parents and his brother, she claims she did type all the info and clicked the ""Add Order"" button, but the system didn't do it because of a VIRUS OR A HACKEEEEEEEEEER!!!!! (A computer that is never conected, by the way.)

She doesn't even know what a virus means; it's just her little crutch to justify she didn't do anything right. If her brother points out the system has never failed to add stuff when he has used it, she pouts and mutters ""Maybe is a virus that comes and goes..."" If he points out the computer is safe from hackers due to not being connected, she stays quiet, but quickly goes back to her old ways.

This problem caused by her has been present in every app they have used.
How can we (my friend and me) explain to her is not the program, but HER?
If / when I finish my app, she's gonna blame it too; no matter how good I made it, it would still have ""lots and lots of viruses that don't let her save stuff.""

We feel that even if we teach her the difference between a virus and a software with a bug, she's gonna scream it's ""has lots and lots of bugs, then.""

If someone asks her: ""Hey, I heard soulblazer made a program for you. You know, I need someone to make a program for me. How good was yours?"" and she starts her rant about ""viruses"" and ""being unable to save stuff"", I'm gonna sound like a thief. I don't want that, neither does my friend.

Other than convincing the parents to ban her from using the restaurant computer and changing her tasks to cooking the food, or asking for orders (we don't want her to be fired over this), we don't know what to do.

I would like to add that this was not communicated well to the client recently due to a whole host of personal problems, which unfortunately had serious impacts on my ability to work.

The problems arise with the fact that as the project has been under development, more and more requirements have been added to it.

I have a few projects in need of freelance developer(s). First and foremost is an experienced web dev for an ASP.NET MVC project. I am not a recruiter.

I checked prior questions/answers... There are a lot of helpful responses regarding assistance for Freelancers, but nothing I could find regarding where the best place to FIND [serious, professional] freelancers would be.

As a freelancing community, where do you look for the most dependable freelance project work?  I would prefer to stay away from sites such as CraigsList, and do not wish to go through an ""IT Service"" company that just recruits other devs and turns paperwork.

Thanks in advance for your responses.

My clients are in the luxury industry so I have to research a lot of information. They are a concierge that caters to celebrities. They are more concerned towards their brand (as most lux brands are) so I cannot do a lot of tests as often as regular marketers should. The problem is, testing is the core of marketing. We test to figure out what works best for our goals. Copying similar brands in the same industry is expensive.

Right now, I get paid by the hour. The owners are old-fashioned therefore I understand why they don't want to invest in something they're not sure might work. Besides, they never really had the need to do offline marketing because they get their customers by referrals. (I just figured that I bring this up just in case someone asks about it.)

I now know that I should include overhead to my prices. Otherwise, I would not be able to run this.

Should my rates be determine by my experience-even more so-than liability? With liability I mean by the mistakes I will end up having.

I have seen many freelancers craft a personal site and a freelance/professional site, and they would put their ""seeking-full-time-job"" style resume in the Personal site, and put their portfolio and freelance projects on their business/professional website. This seems like overkill - but on the other hand, I do not want someone to see my resume on my consultancy site and interpret this somehow as unprofessional.

1128,"After leaving a major media conglomerate following four years as a manager, I accepted my first freelance/contract role in an industry I plan to transition toward. It is a four month assignment for a flat-rate weekly stipend with an increasing hourly commitment as follows:
Weeks 1-2, 10 hr/wk
Weeks 3-9, 20 hr/wk
Weeks 10-16, 40 hr/wk.

My contract specifically lays out my role as helping to execute a trade show from the marketing/sponsorships perspective as a liaison between external event sponsors and the internal marketing and events teams. When the stipend is broken down in the latter weeks, the hourly rate is equivalent to less than minimum wage. I was not delighted with the level of payment, but saw it as means to an end given my career redirection following grad school and nine post-education years in the events workplace.

During week 7 of the contract, I was introduced to a project an intern had left unfinished which the company I am working for was paid $20k to execute. The marketing project includes a digital campaign and directed industry survey which will ultimately run for approximately two months. Since I am new to freelancing, I was hesitant to come across as less than a team player, but I have now been told in writing that I am to own the full rollout and wrap-up of this project alongside my contracted work, since the person who contracted me has no more bandwidth for completing it himself in the lead-up to the same event I am working on. The sponsor for which the marketing survey and campaign is being created is not in any way affiliated with the event I was contracted to help execute. 

1) I am now concerned that I will not be able to execute my contract points as well given the time I have and will continue to have to dedicate to the side project.
2) I don't know if I am in too deep to now repeat and push my concerns with the department head who has assigned the work to me.
3) Since this is a completely separate project, not even a scope creep related to the event I was hired for, am I within my rights to request an additional stipend or compensation for the extra work?

I have a feeling I have a lot to learn here, but I'd rather learn it now.

Now, it's clear that most contracts do not lead to dispute, and most disputes are settled outside the court. However, it seems the value of a contract is as a deterrent against the worst-case scenario, e.g. a lawsuit in case the work is completed and the client refuses to pay. To be an effective deterrent, the contract surely needs to be written with appropriate legal language, which varies between jurisdictions.

Long story short:


I work there as an analyst, writing up reports based on my findings;
I have built a custom Microsoft Access database for the team;
I am leaving (for personal reasons); and
they want me to do my analysis work on a freelance basis.


At present I earn around £40,000 (not the actual amount - this is for the purpose of this example) as a full-time permanent member of staff.

The reason I have been asked to work freelance is simply because I am an expert in my field.  My work was initially going to be divided between the team members, but nobody there has skills that are advanced enough to do what I do to the level and standard that I complete it to.

Further to this, I have built an Access database from the ground up and it has now been used by the team for a number of years - as with before, nobody is knowledgeable enough to be able to take up the database administration once I leave.

Based on that, what would be an acceptable daily rate to charge instead?  My thoughts were that I would charge £400 per day (example figure).

EDIT: (29/09/2016):


The work will be carried out off-site; and
I will not be working full-time - it will be on an ad-hoc basis only, I imagine  perhaps around 25 days per year.


EDIT: (30/09/2016):


I have also dabbled in the idea of charging them per report as I am, in reality, going to be producing a product for them.  Therefore, my idea was £2,000 per report as each report will take approximately five days to complete.

So I really was primed for a big change, but not sure what I could do to change things dramatically enough.

I did 2 bigger and 2 smaller projects for him and all where catastrophic. He is terrible in project management and getting specs and offers straight and is horrible at communicating with clients. He is really pushy like the world would end if we didn't ship tomorrow, even though all projects where heavily delayed.

All these projects where really, really stressful for me and I only did the follow up projects because I was in the process of buying an appartment and needed the money.

There was never a problem with money, he always paid in time and sometimes he even did compensate for the extra time. I was loyal as well and did some smaller change requests for free.

Now there's a big change in the underlying shop system of that bigger project and he needs my help. I haven't worked with that shop system for a while and it would take significant time for me to get up to speed again. Therefore it's very hard to give an estimate and I already know that estimating for him is very crucial, because things tend to escalate.

I am self employed 
I work remote and choose my own hours
I can say yes or no to any projects he gives me
I can take as much time off as I want with next to no warning required (there are obvious exceptions to this)
I can, and do, take breaks to work with other clients periodically

It was at this time that he asked me if I would like to get paid directly. To this I readily agreed to. Because of this sudden change no contract of any sort was drawn up. At the time I also had no reason to doubt that I would get paid. Because:


I had already been paid by him twice already
His business was in a tail spin when I joined. I personally replaced 5 other developers.  Meaning he needs me. (He seems to attract all the freelancers who don't know what they are doing)


And that being said I do always get paid, but I have yet to be paid without having to remind him. 

The way payment is supposed to work is I send him my time sheet every Tuesday and he pays me for the previous Monday to Sunday. He apparently pays about half of his freelancers this way. The others are paid via the freelancing platform. He is in Australia and I am in the UK so I send him my time sheet every Monday evening my time. By the time I get up on Tuesday it is already about 5pm down under so he has had all day to pay me. I normally wait till Tuesday evening my time before messaging him and every time, like clock work, he get back with the phrase ""I will pay today"". He has only once said sorry, normally it's just those 4 words. 

It's Wednesday today and even after a reminder this morning still no payment. If I was to say what I feel then I'd be gone in a heart beat and at the loss of a weeks pay since there is no contract.

As I understand, incorporating yourself can be advantageous in terms of protecting your personal assets from any liability, as well as having tax benefits... But I have no idea about whether it is worth doing, or how to go about it if so.

What are the pro's and con's of incorporating yourself? Are there particular circumstances where it would definitely be best to do so/ not to do so? How can I decide whether it is right for me?

I am developing a web project for the client (it's a small company of about 10 employee), the site has a very nice modern bootstrap responsive template with full screen images in background, html5 flipping books, etc.

The problem is that I have to publish in this website 26 PDF catalogues, of about 30 to 50 pages each. These catalogues are self made, they don't want to spend money so someone inside the company does the catalogues in MS Word, but believe me, to put the pages of these catalogues in the site is like a punch in the face and a kick in the teeth togheter.

I can't put here the catalogues for obvious reasons but imagine in MS Word, add a black background (with white borders around), insert the logo in the first page (the logo background has a different point of black, so you see a nice square), insert a picture directly from the camera or phone as it is, add a yellow text in Comic CAPS like ""NEW CATALOGUE 2016-2017"". Then all the following pages are tables with low quality misaligned pictures and Comic texts around. Some pictures was clipped with magic wand and have ugly borders... Then all is printed to PDF by a freeware plugin. OK you got the idea...

It's really a pity to ruin a very nice website inserting hundreds of these pages, so I suggested to the client to:


Redo all the catalogues in the proper professional way.
Abandon the idea of flipping books, use an e-commerce style web catalogue,  using only the single images and adding the description in the backend.
Put the catalogues only as downloadable files not showing anything of them.


He is very stubbord and he doesen't want to do anything of that, because he doesen't want to lose time or spend money. He told me that the catalogues are pretty good and he wants to see in the site the catalogues as they are, in the form of browsable flipping books.

How can I make him understand that it's going to be a suicide in terms of company image? What would you do in this case? Do you have to face clients that pretend to be good graphic designers or to have good graphical taste but they absolutely and objectively don't?

1164,"I'm a one-man shop. 

Have a few separate computer systems:


Primary desktop workhorse where 90% of my work is completed.
Laptop, capable of some work (apps installed), but in general used for communication, etc while traveling
Various tablets/smart phones never really used for ""work"" but maybe communication.


This past weekend I had what appears to be a video card issue in my primary system. I can work, but it's taken me from 3-30"" monitors down to 1 monitor. Still able to work, but I feel exceptionally hobbled.

I live in a small town and can't just run out for a new video card - ordered one online but it'll be 2 days before it arrives. 

So, my main workstation is crippled, but functional. 

This got me to wondering. What if the main system died entirely and was unusable. What's a good backup plan for such an instance? 

I can't always stall for 3-4 days and wait for a new system, then spend 3-4 more days installing software, etc/ to get it in working condition. A week of unscheduled unavailability is generally far too much.

I'm hesitant to just set up a second system as a backup due to costs. I'd really never need it except in emergencies but cost for the hardware/software licenses could easily approach 5 figures. That seems untenable from a business perspective. In the past I've used the laptop for a week while waiting on a new system. But due to the speed of technology, the laptop is now out of date and possibly underpowered. It could be used, but it would probably mean working at less than 30% of my normal speed.

Data isn't an issue. I have triple redundant backups and even with a complete utter system failure I can be back up and running in a day at most if the hardware is functional.

I have tons of spare hard drives. So if a drive dies, I'm covered.

I have an extra HDTV that, in a pinch, can be used as a (horrible) monitor.

But what about actual hardware failures - CPU, video card, power supplies, etc.?

(Note I'm a Mac-based office. Always have been [20+ years]. So, it's not like I can have an extra power supply for my MacPro laying around.)

I'm thinking about possibly something like an iMac.. but spending a couple grand for a system I don't really need is troubling me.

If there were a place local that rented systems, I'd consider that. One-day rental of an adequate system runs in the neighborhood of $300 though. That seems ridiculous. In fact for a week of rental I may as well buy another system.

1184,"In a nutshell, I've been doing freelance iOS development for a client on an ongoing basis since 2013.  Originally my main contact with the business was, let's say, Person A.  Recently the client has brought on a new person to manage the project, let's call them Person B.  Person B hasn't replaced Person A (as in, Person A is still with the business), rather has just supplanted Person A's role as primary point of contact on the project.

The established pattern of work, with Person A, was that I'd quote the cost of a round of development, they'd approve it, and then when I was done I would deliver application binaries together with an invoice for the work.  After the invoice was paid, I would refresh the client's internal Git repository with a copy of the application source-code.  That worked well and as far as I'm aware kept everybody happy.

However, recently I submitted my binaries and invoice for the latest bundle of work, and then was informed by Person B that I'd not receive payment until I also provided the source-code.  I responded that as a matter of policy I don't do that, and I've not heard anything back from Person B since then, nor received any payment.  It's been about a week since I've heard anything from them now.

Some other potentially relevant points:


The work I'm invoicing for is almost entirely work that Person A approved.
Person B did not mention their desire to receive source-code in advance nor did I (or would I) agree to such a thing, and in fact their process tends to treat independent contractors more like internal developers; they simply create tickets in Jira and then expect people to work on them without further discussion.
In 2015, when the client was setting up their internal Git repository, I explicitly stated that I would not submit any code into it prior to receiving payment, and there were no objections at the time.
I've not had any issues with this client in terms of non-payment or demands that I do things that I never agreed to do as condition of payment in the past.  It has, until recently, been an amicable and productive relationship.
I'm confused as to why I'm getting the silent treatment from Person B.
The binaries I provide prior to invoicing are always fully functional and production ready.  I do not prevent the client from immediately deploying them to end-users.
The project is generally fairly informal; there's no ""official"" contract and all work is planned, quoted, and approved by e-mail.
I'm in Australia, where written promises exchanged by e-mail do count legally as civil contracts.


So I'm somewhat at a loss with respect to where I go from here.  

Do I give them the source code, when I never agreed to do such a thing, and when I'm pretty sure that doing so is highly unprofessional if not basically crazy?  

Do I stand my ground, and if so, how do I get past the impasse with Person B seemingly freezing me out?  

What I have at the moment is a draft e-mail to Person A (with Person B CC'ed), which reads like:


  Hi Person A, are you able to assist with this?  Person B and I appear to
  be at an impasse.  
  
  I value our professional partnership and the opportunity to work on
  this project, however I'm unsure from where, when, or why this
  expectation of receiving source-code prior to payment has
  materialized.  As an independent contractor, I do not transfer
  ownership of the source code I develop on behalf of Busisness Name (or any
  other client) until the work that's gone into it has been paid in
  full.  This is a matter of policy, and something which I made clear in
  2015 to Project Contact when he was the main point of contact for this
  project.  It's never been an issue before.  
  
  As I've provided binaries which demonstrate that the functionality
  covered in the invoice sent on 11 November 2016 has been implemented,
  and as (to the best of my knowledge) those binaries have been deployed
  to testers and/or end users, I would appreciate it if that invoice
  would now be paid.  
  
  Or if there are any technical faults which you've identified in the
  work submitted, please advise and I'll correct them as quickly as
  possible.  In the absence of any such advice, however, I can only
  consider the work completed and the invoice payable. I'll happily
  refresh the git repository with the latest sources upon receipt of
  payment, but unfortunately under no circumstance can I do so
  beforehand.
  
  Thanks,
  Me.

A business partner (BP) of mine introduced me to a company (X) where I have done web development now for several years. How it originally worked was–I would invoice BP, and he would invoice X (adding 20% for his fees).

At one point I found it was actually easier for me to deal directly with the client. I was essentially handling all of the client requests. So I offered to do the estimates and invoicing, and I would just pay BP the 20% difference. This way BP didn't have to add an extra step.

This has been an ongoing agreement, and over time I have been feeling like I do all of the work - why should I be paying him the 20% increase. When I brought it up to BP he said that it isn't technically a finder's fee, and that its an Industry Standard to expect 20% from clients that have been referred. 

BP has a valid point in that he generated the relationship with X - its a client that he has been working with for years (even if he hasn't been for the last 7 years or so). I would not have this client if it wasn't for BP. On the other hand, I have also been nurturing the relationship with X for the last 7 years.

BTW-this wasn't just thrown at me, it was in our initial and ongoing agreement - not like there were any surprises here. So I take full responsibility for taking on the ""dealing directly with client"" - I preferred it to having to try to coordinate with BP and the Client.

So - I have chosen to honor BP's request, as I really value the relationship. But it scratched that part of my brain that wanted to get second opinions.

What are the industry standards for Finder's Fees (percentage
wise, is 20% reasonable)?
Would what I described above fall into
the category of Finder's Fee? If not, what would you call it?
Whatever you call it, is it reasonable to last forever? Or at some
point would the client become my client? He also mentioned that in
these circumstances what usually happens is I would buy out X from
BP. Where BP would determine how much it's worth to give up X. Is
this common?
Do I need to 1099 the BP for the amount I am paying
to BP?

On one hand I'd like to help him out because he hasn't a lot of money and is struggling to start as a freelancer. There aren't much jobs available for him. On the other hand he is asking me for help frequently. E.g. if I could make a website for a very low price. When I dropped a reasonably low price ('discount for friends'), he said he didn't have the money and that he would stick to a free self-made website and maybe ask me to create a 'real' website later on. 

We're both in the creative field and I did/do some freelancing as well, so even though we can help each other we can also be competitors. And I wouldn't like my camera to be damaged or broken, even if they would pay me back some of the value I'd still have to buy a new one (and spend money).

Question: If I decide to lend him the camera for his freelance work, what arrangements are reasonable to propose?

Location: Europe. I'm not seeking legal advice, only what would be reasonable to propose.

E.g. if they break the camera they have to pay back the amount of money I bought it for? 

Nowadays it's worth less, but if I have to buy a new one I'd spend money I wouldn't spend (and like to spend) otherwise. I'm satisfied with this camera.

Should we write down some agreement? I don't think he has the money to pay the amount right now. How to handle this matters for acquaintances/friends? I don't want this to influence our relationship.

So I figured that there has to be way to be very clear about that, the same way I only sign their contracts (non-disclosure and payment contract), is there a way to be really specific about how I will work? Something like a contract for saying that I won't spend more than whatever time on meetings, and that I won't be responsible for any other thing that the programming I do, so assets and everything else besides programming will be client's responsibility.

Only difference is ours would be completely free and ad supported, hopefully before we get too big we could generate enough revenue to justify paying for better hosting than what we are currently thinking of, which is hosting it from our houses and using an email relay.

I have seen the complaints about upwork and read a couple articles about how much other freelance IT sites charge a lot in commissions.

The price for us to run the site will be fairly minimal, we are thinking about $20 a month for the email relay, $1 for the first year for the domain provided we can find a good one no one else is squatting. The price of internet to our homes provided we don't get blacklisted or DDOSed. I have a couple good servers sitting around collecting dust. Figure have everyone use paypal to take care of payment or what ever method they agree on to keep that part out of my hands.

It should take about 3 months from start to finish before going live. So the only ture investment is out time.

My though are, and correct me if im wrong please. I should have no problem getting IT people to sign up, being in the freelance IT world for about 15 years Im pretty sure of the demand.

How to get the people that will actually pay the IT people to go and use the site? Besides SEOing the crap out of the site is there any other things I might think about before setting out on the endeavor?

Also, english is not my main language, I can easily read, write, communicate efficiently in written form (within my limits), but when it comes to skype meetings I think I would be in difficulty to keep a good conversation (while in general I would be enough good to express myself and understand spoken english).

I turned over the work ready-to-use.  He had to compile text, add attachments, etc. He did that part all alone.   I gave only the clean working software and he payed me as required.

There are videos from TV channels, pictures from Google searches, pieces of movies, PDF documents as well as many other resources he likely accessed on the internet.

I told him that he can't sell this material since it amounts to (surely) infringing on copyrighted resources, but his response was ""don't worry, all that is publicly visible is original, I took this materials only for teaching purposes and also is sent one-to-one in private email address, so none will find out and also they can't make my emails public because they will break the privacy laws.""

So far, all projects I saw on freelancing sites or via personal connections were of max $100k.

My question is, are such large project offered to the remote teams or they are reserved strictly for companies that have local office in that country (so they better deal with legal issues in trouble time)?

The root of this question is that I have never seen such projects offered online to remote teams. So I would like to know they rules and chances to bid to such large projects.

First, I'm realizing more and more that the required work is outside of my skillset (I know, it was a pretty hasty decision).
Second, I'm already foreseeing friction between us. The client isn't willing to make necessary changes to her website due to her personal preferences.


All in all, I think that it would be best to end the relationship. I want (need) to handle this gracefully, especially because this client is a very close friend of another one of my clients, with whom I am currently in good standing.

How do I best explain this to the client? Over the phone or in writing? (It's a remote job, so I can't meet face-to-face.) Should I include my second reason listed above? Thanks in advance.

I don't have a domain name for my Humans of Newtown page, and at this point I don't particularly want one - but I do need a Humans of Newtown email to add to my business card. Currently I'm just using a gmail address - but is that unprofessional?

And mainly, because web development is what I'm most likely to get paid for - I need a business email @blacksheepcode.com for doing work there. 

The question is - is there a way to set up multiple email addresses without having to pay separately for each one? - Given that I'm not currently earning money from these side projects, these costs quickly add up.

For myself: I would pay for my own benefits, pay my own taxes, etc. HOWEVER, I quit my previous fulltime because I wanted some freedom and to build this consulting business out, so joining on as fulltime at this client's company is something I really want to avoid.

1238,"EDIT- Edited as requested to be less of an open-ended question. That said I did receive some very useful advice. I contacted our local PHP meet up who passed me onto a local developer. Also, since countless hours on PPH, Upwork and the like, I discovered I needed to be much more focused in terms of my brief from a technical stand point.

Question edited as per below:

First a bit of background info - We have a project that's been dropping down our to do list for almost a year. It's an internal project, one I'm keen to get live. I'm personally coming to you from a content stand point, and without a website to work with, I myself am stuck. Our internal developers are currently far too busy with client work - in our daily standup, their sprints are always full week to week so I wouldn't want to take them off projects they're currently invested in.

This has therefore lead me to look for a freelancer that I can outsource this one project to. There would be a possibility for more work should this one go well, however the difficulty I am finding isn't getting hold of a developer keen to do one-off projects, but finding a quality developer.

As I am not a developer myself defining quality may be a little more difficult - but from the feedback I have received from our devs here, it's how clean the code is, the methods used to build the code, the documentation and the like. I now have a four-page PDF with our requirements which has been super useful. This is to ensure quality and to allow my own developers to jump into the code in future.

I've tried - People Per Hour, Upwork, Elance, Twitter, LinkedIn, Toptal and Codeable, all to no real avail.

PPH - Here I had the most 'bids' on my job, but most very cheap and the example sites didn't look good in terms of design nor code. I should mention I'm willing to pay for quality.

Upwork - Much better than PPH in terms of quality, but after speaking with some of the top-rated developers, as soon as I handed them our more technical requirements a lot said 'I use html and CSS, I don't touch SASS or Git or Laravel' etc, which doesn't fit with our methods here making it more difficult for us to make future edits and keep our quality high.

The other sites - I found either had too much spam or similar to PPH.

The best response I had was to contact our local PHP meet up and now I am in talks with a local developer who said all our technical requirements are as expected, no problem at all. So this is a positive lead.

So my questions


I now have a list of technical requirements from my own developers. As freelancers I understand this may not be something you would expect, but would you find it useful? Does it help bring clarity on the project?
With this project being a fair investment, there is a sense of trust between client and freelancer. How can that trust be strengthened? Once again does my list of requirements help if the freelancer can agree to these?
While I understand most freelance developers have their own ways of doing things, is there a way I can make it clear that I want my site built a certain way without putting anyone off? It's like asking for a baker to make a cake and giving them the ingredients.
More off topic - should developers be able to build from design concepts or is a pixel-perfect design always preferred? This is more of out of interest since I've had varying responses to preference. I've only supplied flat-PDFs so far before committing and some have said that's all they need, others have requested my PSDs.
And finally - is a freelancer even right for what I am looking for? Am I asking too much of one person? Should I be looking at going to an agency instead?


Any help as always greatly appreciated.

Long story:
I was approached by Headhunter A from the UK, she wanted me to give her my CV as a .doc-file. Then she forwarded me to Headhunter B, which she said was a colleague but in reality is a different company (in germany). Now B wants me to introduce myself to the final client (Company C, also germany), but in the name of a different company: IT Consultant D (germany).
If I would go through with that contract, I would work fulltime as a freelancer for Company C for almost a year, at Company C in the name of Consultant D and will have a contract with Headhunter A.

I am pretty sure that I won't take this offer, because of Scheinselbständigkeit (german equivalent of Misclassification of employees as independent contractors) and the obvious reason: That this is not normal.

I am from germany but in all my projects until now, I worked for companies outside of germany.

So my question: Is this normal, am I overreacting? Is this maybe normal for german companies?
Headhunter A wanted my CV as .doc, she promised not to change anything, but I am pretty sure, she redacted my contact-info. Or is there another reason why someone would prefer .doc over .pdf?

Thanks for the responses so far.

I ask Headhunter B for clarification and the constellation would be like that:

Freelancer F will have a contract with Headhunter B (from germany). This contract will state that F has to tell Customer C that F works for D (IT consultant that work for C). F has to work for 12 month full time at the office of C and will do every work D gives him.

This is waaaay below anything I would normally charge, by the way. I am a young woman (23) and he specified he was looking for a student to do the work so I should have seen the red flags.

Two months later and only $100 payment received, this guy was texting me every day, trying to get me to go to these weekly meetings that were outside of our agreement, never giving me enough notice, started showing a bit of a short temper, and overall just making me uncomfortable and being way too demanding.

He kept badgering and twisting things around as he usually does and eventually I told him very politely that I could not continue working on the project, but would carry out the work in the next few weeks and help with his transition.

Next thing you know he tells me he will not be paying me for February since now he has to look for someone else. So I tell him that I will not work without payment. He tells me he will consider paying me when the work is done, and continues to send me messages and emails (one was an approx 4000 word email about how he was a visionary and I was not seeing the value in the work).

1248,"About 6 years ago I worked as a freelance web designer, developer and products photographer for a local company (15 minutes of car distance from my office) that works in the fashion industry.

At some point they needed a more intensive service that I couldn't phisically provide (being a single worker) so they moved to a bigger agency with specialized teams of many workers. This agency is at 1,5 hours of car distance from the client.

The client after 6 years contacted me again because he wants me to provide him the products photography service because for him is too expensive and time consuming to bring the products to the agency, and the quality of the photos made by that agency is less or equal than the photos that I did for him.

In short words, he will give me a room at his factory, I should be there on a weekly or bi-weekly basis to shoot products photos, the products can be maybe 50 to 80 pieces (hats, bags, etc) each time, each piece should be made in 5 views (front, rear, etc), then I should take all these pictures and do the post-production in my office and return them to the clients in 3-4 different formats. He wants also me to assure that service with a 2 or 3 days or forewarning, each time he needs that job to be done, he will call me and in 2 or 3 days I should be there.

He said that this could be a long lasting work, if all goes good that could go on for years.

We already discussed the prices and he seems ok with that, we should meet by the end of february to try to organize the work for the next months (we did not agree yet to start or not, just discussed about it).

I have already many clients with long lasting good relationship and I don't know if I will be able to properly follow all of them if I take that new job. And I don't feel like disregard or abandon other clients because if this client will go elsewhere (as already happened) I'll remain with no other clients.

I asked the client if we can ""concentrate"" the photo shootings once a month, so I know that the first week of the month I have that task to do and for the rest of the month I can follow others jobs. He answered that this is not good for him because he sells a lot in e-commerce and when he has products to sell they must be ready as soon as possible not the month after.

I also have another problem: along the year my work schedule is already fixed for other clients. I have clients that does important trade fairs, conferences, etc, they usually call me 1-2 months before to say ""please be available to work for me in the first week of july because I have that important trade fair..."". In these periods I will not be available for the photo shootings with 2-3 days of forewarning.

The job is very interesting, I am specialized in products photography and it will be an easy going task with a trusted client and good earnings, but in the other hand he is too demanding with time commitment and availability, I already know that I will have problems with other clients for the above said reasons.

I thought that I could hire myself other freelance collegues to help me, I did that in the past, but the other clients were not happy that I sent them to another freelancer or sometimes I had problems with the general work quality.

There was absolutely no mention of source code, change in code ownership, etc. when the deal was made back in 2015. The project was a modified form of my existing app, which existed before the deal, and the client obviously has no ownership in it. There was no contract. The deal was something like this:

Client: Can you make a new app for me? I want the following features ...
Myself: OK. This is the price ....


Unfortunately, the client has been refusing to pay off the final installment which is about $42 AUD. I sent him my bank details on how much he had already paid, and how much he still owed. He agreed the transaction was not complete, but still refused to pay. The project is partially paid.

He is trying to negotiate and bargain with me for the final installment. He insisted I had to send him the source code, something never agreed. He also wants total ownership of everything, but without explicit written agreement (https://www.ipaustralia.gov.au/understanding-ip/getting-started-with-ip/ip-ownership), he'd only be given the non-exclusive rights to distribute the app.

Basically, he's bargaining for:


""Update"" and ""upgrade"" the app whenever he wishes
Access the source code because he thinks he ""paid"" for it


Question

What's the best way to address this situation? I'm currently sending him overdue notices, and avoiding to negotiate for something that I should receive unconditionally. Every time he tries to negotiate, I simply reply with a payment notice (and nothing else).

It goes like this:

When brainstorming a large task, he often proposes extremely low-quality solutions that would be impossible to maintain and aren't acceptable on a professional project; sometimes he even starts implementing these solutions without getting approval first. These aren't minor, ""this could probably be refactored"" design issues, but massive flaws that would have far-reaching repercussions if implemented in his way.

I've only complained about him directly to the client once, when he kept failing at the same simple task over and over for two weeks and was preventing us from meeting a deadline; I only addressed that single issue and not his overall ability. Since then, he's been better, but better is far short of competent. Working with him is infuriating, but I haven't approached the client about this because I don't know how to express my feelings in a professional way. He does many other tasks for the client that I am not involved in and I have no idea how he performs at those tasks; since the client hasn't fired him yet, it is possible that he is more competent on other tasks or that the client is very forgiving.

How do you explain to a client that one of their other freelancers is not competent at his job, in a professional but compelling manner?

1258,"I don't know if this is the right place to ask, but I was wondering if it is a fair exchange to offer equity instead of payment for services in business.

For example, ""John"" signs a contract stating that he will receive equity in the revenue of whatever industry/company/etc. he is contributing to, instead of paying him for doing it. It isn't ""free work"" because equity stake can be worth a lot of money should the business grow big -- and a contract guarantees he/she gets their cut. In such eyes, equity stakes can be more rewarding than a single payment for a service. Here's an example:

Bob is trying to start a company, but needs suppliers. He offers the suppliers equity stake in his future earnings indefinitely should they provide him with the supplies he needs to start his business. It may not be that he can't pay nor doesn't want to invest himself. Perhaps he has faith in his business expanding and will fairly share the stake he offers to the service provider for the rest of his business.

In other words, he would rather his investors take their chances like him, but have the ability to earn their share of the company's/etc. success continuously, as opposed to only a one-time exchange.

In general, is this bad practice? Would this be a good or bad thing to offer to high-quality freelancers looking for work: an equity stake instead of money/benefits directly?

- Good understanding of 3D modeling
- Understanding of image editing but no real digital art skills

The ""banking website"" will not allow users to readily transfer money to other users. There's physical verification required, which I am not familiar as it is overseas.

But I realized, this can be used for illegal.
The application allows logging in to a ""banking website"", even though it cannot ""confirm"" or ""bypass"" the verification to successfully authorize the money transfer, just the fact that the application can login to this financial institution's records can be alarming.

I mean, if the employer decided to scrape the sensitive information, or get the username/password _POST request then record it, isn't that illegal? Isn't that phishing? Isn't that fraud?

When I started working on the template I talked about it to one of the managing partners of company A and she pointed me to some good resources that helped me make the template. Another employee also spent an hour or two improving the template, based on my instructions.

Am I right in believing I did nothing wrong by distributing the template freely with my logo, or is company A correct in saying the template is theirs and I have an ethics problem? (yes, those are their words)

I'm leaning towards suggesting my coworker incorporate as his own business. We can both contribute to the technical blog together if he would like. 

Questions:

1) I'm leaning toward suggesting he incorporate as his own freelance consultant company instead of us splitting the one I started. Does that make sense?

2) If we both contribute to a content-marketing blog, how would we split the client work? I guess we would need to figure that out ourselves?

The app is a mobile app and generates income via in-app purchasing and ads. So how do I get X percents of the profit? How do I know the amount of profit on monthly/yearly basis?

1299,"First things first:

I worked with company in a project for client, where I was simply a developer that did the tasks defined by company.

client then decides that he wants to make his own team after company contract finishes, so client contacts me, and after several months, I am part of his team, separated from company. In the team, there's a randomGuy who would act as CTO.

randomGuy is terribly arrogant. Even though he knows nothing about programming and doesn't understand anything technical about the project, he has this prepotent attitude where he questions me about literally everything. But OK, fine; I leave my pride aside and I try to be professional about it.



Situation:

An issue that I had reported several times to company and was never resolved because company didn't manage a task for it appears again, since we want to publish the app. randomGuy asks me about it; I answer what I just said; ""company is well aware of it; if they told you that it's ready for publication, then that issue must have been resolved by them"".

A day after, randomGuy writes to company:


  (My name) made us aware of an issue. I was never told about this and
  (My name) says that we're still waiting on you to work with us to deal
  with this.




My problem:

My reaction was ""is randomGuy (unnecessarily) putting me in a position of conflict with company, who was my client, who has contacted me for other work unrelated to this project?!""

I'm baffled by this. If I were company, I wouldn't ever work again with a freelancer that not only blames me, but also creates a conflict situation, when it isn't needed at all.

I feel like randomGuy has hurt my reputation with company and that I've potentially lost company as a client, and he has not behaved like a team player, much less like a leader. He could have contacted company without creating this conflict with me in the center of it. I feel like I need to call him out on this, to be clear that I don't want to work with someone that behaves like this, and that I expect this to be the last time he does something like this.

What are your thoughts? Was randomGuy attitude unprofessional? Is my reputation with company irreparably broken? How (and should I) talk about this with randomGuy?

1330,"TL;DR

I quoted Company A a fixed price amount to write some software using a product from a particular Vendor (that I selected).  But these products didn't work as advertised and I discovered multiple show-stopping bugs.  I spent considerable time and effort researching the root cause of the bugs and convincing tech support that the bugs actually existed.  In effect I was doing free QA for the Vendor for their commercial products.  In doing so I burnt through more than my wildest dreams of the contingency time I built into my fixed price quote.  Can I ask the Vendor for compensation?  Or do I just have to suck it up?

The long version

2 months ago Company A (who I know well) asked me if I wanted to take on a small software project that involved supplying some 3rd party hardware and integrating it into their system.  I googled around for suitable hardware, and worked up a fixed price quote for about 1 1/2 weeks work - which included reasonable extra contingency time based on my experience in the problem domain.

In doing my searching the Vendors products matched my requirements almost perfectly.  Choosing products from a different vendor would have meant building a much more complex system with less functionality.

I then got Product 1 from the Vendor.  Day 1 of using product 1 I run into a show stopping bug. I spend time investigating the issue and finally submit a ticket to the Vendor. 24 hours later they fixed the bug (which was totally obvious if anyone had actually used the product). Later on I run into another show stopping bug.  This time it literally takes me days to convince tech support that there is an issue.  Finally they admit that there is a bug and instead of trying to fix it, they offer me my money back.  When pressed they finally say ""it's an obscure bug in an older product, and we don't have the expertise to fix it now."".  So basically I am screwed over that product.

Next I get product 2 from the Vendor that uses a different technology and hopefully won't have the same obscure bug as the last one (but it does entail a rewrite of the interface section).  Right off the bat I start seeing something that I think is a bug, but because it seems random I can't put my finger on it.  But after days worth of testing it eventually it becomes more and more obvious that it is not me.  So I submit a ticket.  Tech support basically comes back with ""Nah, its you, it's not us"".  I can't prove a thing so I let it drop.  A couple of days later I run into a different, show stopping bug. I spend time proving its them and not me, and submit a bug.  This one is so obvious and they admit that it caused major discussions in their office about how things should actually work before they came up with a solution.  Then I am back to doing burn-in tests and start running into that ""random"" bug that I first encountered.  I profile my code and the system and start to get an understanding of where and when the issue is triggered.  I re-open the conversation with tech support, but they keep denying that its them and when they actually do reproduce the behavior on their end they discount it as not being their issue.  Eventually (after significant testing) I come up with smoking gun that points directly back to them and is reproducible 100% of the time.  That was yesterday and I am still waiting to hear their reply. 

Now to the actual question.  I took on a fixed price contract with Company A and chose to complete it with the Vendors product.  Being fixed price I knew that I was taking on risk, but if the Vendors products had worked as advertised, or close to then that risk was under control.  However I  ran into multiple show stopping bugs in the the Vendors products.  Researching and identifying the root causes of these bugs has cost me significant amount of time well and easily over a factor of 10 over any contingency I considered.  I feel put out by the because I feel like I have had to lead them around by the nose and point directly at the issues and make the issues so obvious that the Vendor can't ignore them.  In this respect I feel like I have been acting as free QA for their products and have put in significant hours in doing so.

So is their anyway I can approach the Vendor and say something like (albeit it politely)


  I have spent a significant about of time researching the root causes
  of the  screwups in your products and doing the QA that your own team
  was too dumb or too lazy to do.  You owe me Bud.


I don't feel that I can go back to Company A and ask for more (although I might be able to get more out of them) as it was not their issue.  The amount is also not high enough to justify bringing in lawyers as I would easily pay out what I got back.  But anyway I have no actual monetary loses, just my time, as I am waiting for another company to get back to me with their next project for me - and their projects make this one look like peanuts in comparison.

Should I inform the contest that he has an unpaid contract? 
Or, should I wait until after he actually seems like he can pay? I assume that this TV show will at least get this product some customers so he can pay his bills.

Say I receive a PSD or AI file from a client, who I assume worked with a designer on how they want their site to look. Several fonts are included which are not available as web fonts without a subscription to a web font server which costs let's say $50 a year. (Please assume for the sake of this question they don't want to self-host, I'm well aware they could buy individual licenses but this question is ultimately about subscription resources that developers might need in order to complete a client's request)

Having my own subscription may not be difficult for me to do. I could, for example, recoup part of this cost from a client as a necessary expense on their part, and if it's something that I commonly need to use perhaps I need only charge them a small amount as the cost could be spread out. I as a developer could potentially serve numerous clients at a fraction of the cost of what it would cost them to continue paying the fee for their own personal use. 

However, what if I decide to stop paying, or what if I stop gaining clients that need to use the service? Is it my responsibility as a developer to provide this resource, or do I need to let my clients know that they need to purchase their own subscription to maintain access to a resource they want included, and then use their account to integrate it? I'm leaning toward the latter as the safer option for the client and the most logical on my part, but I'm not quite sure of what's expected of me.

In case it matters: Both me and the company are UK based, and I am acting as a member of a partnership (and therefore invoicing under my legal name)

The project has been a little bumpy (as I guess they always are) but everyone seems satisfied now, which is great.

I expected before starting the project that I would be working on a time + materials basis, but I ended up receiving a Purchase Order for the equivalent of the upper limit of my estimate.

Situation is this... on my end project reached completion stage but didn't go live yet (go live is a task of the agency who contracted me). Without going into reasons (there weren't any really, defo nothing related to misconduct or anything similar) they decided to 'end' the contract before the go live happened. So technically, project was finished and they acknowledged it but surely there would be issues or bugs, even during the go live, they would need help with.

1352,"SUMMARY: A customer is satisfied with the quality of services she received but realizes, after the fact, that other service providers charge less. Although there is a difference in the quality of services between the providers, the customer has a hard time seeing it and is now mad at the service provider and wants a fee reduction. Should the provider give her a reduction? Would it really change her mind that the provider tried to take advantage of her? Are there other ways to salvage the customer relationship? If so what?

CONTEXT: I own and operate a very small business (250k/year sales). We sell professional services to individuals, not businesses. The average customer will purchase our services 2 to 3 times in their entire lifetime, and our average invoice is around $6,000. We're in a highly competitive industry with a great many competitors and, as is often the case with services, customers tend to see all competitors as the same. Although our services are not a commodity and I certainly don't see them as such, many people have a hard time differentiating the services of one competitor from another.

It is my strong belief, and I do have some concrete data to back it up, that we offer a better quality of service and achieve better results for our customers than even some of our best competitors and definitely much, much better than our average competitor - the barrier to entry in our industry is relatively low and there is a considerable amount of low quality low-cost players. Accordingly, our fees tend to be higher than those charged by the competition - sometimes 25% to 50% higher than the average competitor, and 5% to 15% higher than some of the best alternatives. Unfortunately, the nature of our business and our services are such that sometimes, the better we are at our job, the harder it is for the customer to see the value in our services (holy %$?! that seemed easy, quick and effortless, why the hell am I giving you so much money?)

PROBLEM: We just finished doing some work for a client that was referred to us. She was referred to us because we have a good reputation in our area and do great work. We talked with this person on the phone, asked her some questions to better understand her needs, sent her a very thorough information package containing our entire service offer, fees, contract and information about our business. We then met with her and signed the contract. Everything went well, we provided her with great service and obtain some great results for that customer. At the end of our mandate, she filled out our online customer survey and gave us a 9 out of 10 in every category.

A few weeks after we were done with the work, but before we are scheduled to receive payment, she gets in touch with us to say that she is mad and feels like we took advantage of her and that we charged her way too much. See, a few people told her that she could have hired some of our competitors for less and she now feels stupid that she didn't shop around and trusted the person that referred her to us. Though she has not directly asked for it, she is hinting that we should substantially lower the amount of our invoice and basically admit that we took advantage of her.

MY TAKE: I feel bad that the customer feels the way she feels and I am sad that what was a pleasant customer relationship turned sour after the fact. It's as if she purchased a BMW or Mercedes, thinking that those were the only cars available, not realizing that there are Toyotas and Hyundais in the world. Now that she realizes that there are Hyundais and Toyotas, she feels like she overpaid for her Mercedes. (They all have 4 wheels, seats and take you from point A to point B, don't they? I got screwed!)

I can't help to think that offering a discount would be an admission that we tried to screw her over (which is absolutely not the case, we offer premium quality services and results, at a premium price) and really, would not be enough to change her opinion of us. A full refund, in this particular case, would represent about 8% of our total forecasted 2017 revenue. I don't want her to start giving us bad word of mouth but at the same time, I'm not sure that the cost to prevent that is equal to what we may or may not lose in potential sales if she ever starts to badmouth us.

QUESTION: Is there anything we can do, that would stand the test of a cost/benefit analysis, to save the relationship? If so, what?

  An invoice must be submitted within 30 days from the end date of the purchase order authorization, or upon completion of the service, whichever occurs first. Failure to submit an invoice within 30 days will be considered a material breach of this contract.  This will result in non-payment of services rendered.


Additionally the contract stated that invoices must be delivered electronically to the E-mail address of the contact person I worked with. The contract specifically said paper-based invoices cannot be accepted. 

At the time I signed the contract I did not see either of these as being a problem. However, right after completing the job I had a family emergency and was away for a couple of weeks. With everything going on the invoice just slipped my mind. When I was ""back on track"" I looked at my records and noticed I hadn't invoiced, so I sent the invoice via Email. This was on day number 29 after I'd completed the work. I requested confirmation of receipt of the invoice in the Email. 

I did not get a response on day 30 that my invoice had been received. So, to be safe, I sent it again, again requesting confirmation.

Later the same day, I received a reply to the Email I sent on day 30, saying that I violated the contract by sending my invoice late. They claimed it was received on day 31, apparently a classic off-by-one error on their part,  and therefore I would not be paid. I informed my contact that I had actually submitted the invoice on day 29 but it apparently had not been received. I was given quite a nasty reply, along the lines of ""well next time send it in sooner and that won't happen.""

The first 7 months went well - payments tended to be a week or two late on occasion, which I attributed to disorganization. However, a month ago the accounts receivable reached $25k - at which point I stopped working for the client. Since then, I have a chain of emails and phone calls trying to solicit payment (or partial payment) from the client. I receive responses within 1-3 days - usually a verbal guarantee from the client that I'll receive at least a partial payment within the next week - which has never happened.

I'm now considering taking legal action (a letter from lawyer then sueing). The law firm is willing waive all costs if we do not receive payment, though they will of course take a decent percentage of the payout if we win. This, of course, is all assuming that the client is able to pay (an important variable in this equation).

I'm hoping there is a good rule of thumb out there to determine when its best to begin legal action. My concerns are (1) loss of money and (2) the client becoming uncivil/hostile. Thx.

p.s. - please note this is similar to question 6581 though this addresses a larger outstanding payment ($25,000 vs £100) and, thus, addresses costs of legal action.

1368,"I am an engineering student studying in one of the top schools in my country. I have been tutoring students for about 2 years, sharing my expertise with those who are about to take university entrance exams (mostly high school students).

Students usually find me through my blog where I post articles about problem solving strategies, time management, dealing with stress, building resilience and patience etc. I also share stories of my previous students and their successes in exams.

During sessions, I usually: 


solve difficult, challenging problems
talk to students about common sources of distraction and how to deal with those
talk to families about their attitude towards the student and how they can provide the student with a more efficient environment (I don't charge money for these talks of course, they are usually like tea talks)


So, generally speaking, I work roughly as a personal trainer for these students.

Most of my students say they are satisfied with the learning experience. I regularly provide the students' families with information about the student's progress, and they also openly express their satisfaction and say they are willing to continue with tutoring sessions.

The problem is, after 2-3 months of tutoring 2-4 hours per week, the families suddenly and abruptly change their minds and want to put and end to the sessions, with no display of dissatisfaction or distrust. Am I missing something? Is it possible that I have problems with reading some cues about their attitude towards me? How can I keep my client families wanting to stay with me until the end of the semester?

P.S.: For the sake of comparison, I charge $15 per hour which amounts to $120-$240 per month where an average white collar earns $1200 per month in my country.

EDIT: There are some tutoring centers, located in a building with super crammed and dimly lighted classrooms, employing teachers so incompetent that they are unable to find a proper job at a school, charging $2000 up front per year and these families choose to send their kids to these tutoring centers. Is there a psychological effect of paying up front, where you feel like you have to get the most of what you have just paid, instead of the option I give them where they can choose to cancel whenever they want?

Also I am a single freelance I can't guarantee 100% commitment to your project since I already have long term clients that I have a live and continuous collaboration... But let's talk about the project so I can understand better.""

I'm an electronic developer with knowledge in hardware, firmware and a bit of software.

Ten years ago I began my own freelance activity. I never thought about the business plan. Until now it's pretty straight:


  I wait until a customer ask me for something to do, I offer him a quote, if he agrees I do the job.


This was ok at beginning. Now I want to improve it because it has several disadvantages:


it relies on customer needs: if one is not going to develop something new he wouldn't call me
it cannot grow: after I use all my available time, and learned enough to work at reasonable speed, I can't accept more work. 
it's hard to get rid of the limit above hiring someone or even outsourcing some parts of the projects. Hiring someone requires almost to double the activity, while outsourcing a single part require a lot of effort to make clear specifications due to the high level of integration about different aspects of the projects.


By the way, some customers in the agreement explicitly wrote that I cannot give my job to a third person/company, for various reasons.

I kindly ask an help to brainstorming about how to change my business model in order to allow it to grow.

As final note currently my jobs have these characteristics:


custom needs: they fit a specific need. Most of the time they require a single shot. Problem solved, no more activities to do.
develop and prototype, but the production is handled by the customer. This is usually explicitly stated in the requests. And they don't accept a commissioni o the sold units because ""they've already paid me for the job"".

Many online services offer sites ""for free"" then you pay to remove ads if you want. With time many of my small business clients decided to move to these types of services and they are OK with it.
Many other clients (restaurants, shops) don't even want anymore a website, they just open a Facebook page and they too are OK with that.

1405,"I've been self employed providing data collection/analysis services for two years and landed my biggest client, a bank, about two months ago.

I agreed to collect, clean and tag 10,000 (public domain) mortgage contracts that would basically give them a map of every loan that's been issued for every commercial building in their tri-county region for the last 10 years. Said bank will use this data to reach out to business owners who's loans are coming up for refinancing (loans from other banks) so they could get the business to refinance with them. If my client signs on 10 - 20 new loans in the next 5 years using my database they could easily make an additional $1,000,000 in revenue in the next 10 - 15 years. 

I thought I could get the job done in a month so I asked for 2 months. They agreed but decided last minute they only wanted to pay once the job was completed. I agreed to this (mistake No 1?). One strange thing is that I never signed an NDA.

As of today I'm three weeks behind on my original delivery date (of which they seem okay with). I'm almost done but I've realized I've sold myself really short because by the time I'm done/paid the amount of unanticipated extra work I had to do is going to dilute my effective hourly rate to a fifth my market value (since I also racked up out of pocket costs for additional labor).

Short of my written agreement with said client I literally owe them nothing. Since I don't get paid until I give them the database there's nothing really forcing me to stick to the (unfair) agreement I naively made (except morals). What's more I now have a list of at least 30 other banks I could potentially sell this data to.

Is it in bad taste to try to renegotiate for higher compensation? Do I risk loosing their trust in my business as one that ""keeps its word"" if I do that? What should I do?

UPDATE

I decided to resist renegotiating any prior terms and stayed true to my original agreement. I felt this was the right thing to do. I've learned a lot from this experience:


Resist the temptation to use fixed price contracts for work you've never done before. Such instruments are better suited to familiar tasks you've actually done before where the costs are already known. 
Focus on and deliver the lowest hanging fruit first. One of the reasons costs ran away from me on this project was because I was being a perfectionist and wanted to give my client the absolute best product I could. That's a nice goal but perfectionism is costly and sometimes (often?) is down right infeasible (as was my case). Turns out I could have finished this project 4 weeks earlier as the client was satisfied with the ""imperfect"" (by my standards) product.
It's better to reach out for guidance/help from your support community (be that SO, your friends, family) regularly and as you face challenge. I wish I had consulted a trusted friend about this problem sooner as that would've given me a fresh, calm person's perspective on the problem.

The invoice I sent was in last December and have been asking for it to be paid for nearly a year now.

The contract states that payment will happen within two weeks of the first issue of the magazine being put out, but his magazine project has failed and its not being printed. There is nothing in the contract about what happens in this situation yet the client continues to constantly replies to my messages telling me to remember the terms I signed off on in the contract. After regular reminders of the invoice the client is now saying I breached the contract terms by not completing the job, something that isn't covered in the contract, and now is saying he will get his lawyer involved. I want to go ahead with this, not for the money but so he can't think he can just screw people over, but worried about what legal standing I have?

I bill hourly in 1/2 hour increments, but I have not set a minimum number of hours. The issue is I get many small support projects/requests (for example lets 5 requests, that take about 20-30 minutes each) on a weekly basis that usually interrupt my work on a long term projects (lets say 1-2 week project). I may only work on the small project for 20-30 minutes, but the loss of effort/productiveness on the long term project is greater than that. The interruption breaks my flow from getting things done on the long term project. So I'm thinking a 1 hour minimum or maybe a 1.5 hour minimum is not too much to ask. Or is there some other common practice to cover the loss in productivity caused by small support projects/requests.

1473,"I was referred to a potential client who has a very vast project in his mind. The potential client is sensible enough to understand the some of the technicalities and they even split the whole concept into different phases, where one phase is a pre-requisite for the next. The client has no idea about how to approach. 

Each phase is technically feasible and is well within my limits. At the same time, not even one phase is simple. They demand a big deal of brainstorming and finding out a better strategy in approaching their development. Since the phases are inter-connected, the strategy should be valid throughout and not bring any huge re-works.

Not to mention, the cost and time estimations are also to be done for the project - phase wise, considering first phase now. 

So to deal with this, I sent out a detailed email explaining the complexity of the phase, what has to be understood and proposed the following. I told I will take time, analyse the phase in detail, come up with questions, bottlenecks and other anticipated problems. Post this, I have asked the client to come in for a meeting to discuss and decide on how to deal with the bottlenecks and problems. 

Along with these, I did quote a very rough cost to give them an idea of what to expect, with a strong mention of increase or decrease in cost, based on the discussion and decisions. 

The client was pleased with my efforts and dedication. He happily agreed to give all the time required and understood the cost constraints.



So What's The Big Deal

So far so good. But the real issues are as follows:


The scope of the current phase is about n categories having - n elements where each element can have a design (one design or one design for a period of time) with the ability to programmatically create, read, update and delete (CRUD) and send it in all decided ways and all decided means of digital communication. I need to think of a strategy and come up with a generic method that will suit for most (if not all) of the elements, also considering the needs of the next phases in mind. 
This demands at-least a week's time ~ close to 50+ hours which is again a mere anticipation. Also, the project/phase isn't of a common need and the efforts it demands for the strategy has a very little scope of being useful in future.   
This project is the dream project of the client. He has enquired other considered other freelancers/companies but my approach, communication, workflow etc has impressed him a lot. He mentioned he wants to work with me (and other great words which you don't hear often) and relies on me as of now.
To even estimate a fair time and cost that the phase demands, I need to start working on the strategy, analyse what it demands, find out if it brings in any new needs and dig deep to my best to be sure of what I'm getting into.


Although, there is a fair chance I would get this project, my experience has taught me to not take it for granted until we both sign a contract. Now, I can't afford to put in a week's time (or more) to think of a strategy and not get paid if the project doesn't kick off. 

To make it a win-win for both of us, I have decided to ask for - what I have termed as a Project Research Cost to the client. I couldn't decide on a basis to calculate and ask an amount. So, I have decided to ask a small amount that will make me feel secured while doing the needful.



How it's a win-win? 

If the client agrees to work with me, I can reduce the amount I took as Project Research Cost from the agreed upon total cost. If, for some reason, the client is not working with me, he would still have a strategy, which he can use, if he wishes to continue developing with someone else. Remember, the strategy is formed based on the client's decisions after a having a good amount of discussion and debate on project's critical elements.

But, I feel strategy makes the whole difference and it's a fool's decision to provide the strategy for the small Project Research Cost. Although the formed strategy may not be reusable as such for me, it still doesn't make it convincing to give away considering the huge time and effort. 

So, I'm thinking of proposing to deliver a document which will contain the identified questions, problems, bottlenecks and also a Minutes of Meeting which will have details of what was discussed and what was decided by the client. Just that. The strategy and other worked-upon elements (if any) remains with me. 

In my opinion, the client still has valuable document, which to me, is convincing enough to be delivered against the Project Research Cost. I understand the client may not appreciate the value of these documents right away. But, my approach is all about trying to be professional, approach business as business, valuing my efforts, delivering value for value and being careful about not making it easy for my competitor.

What do you think? Do you know of any better approach for my concerns?

I appreciate opinions from anyone and everyone, but I'm looking for, a sort of validation, from a better experienced person.

So, with all of this being said, I will have made around $400-$500 after my current job is done. Since this money is technically ""ill-gotten"" since I used Upwork as a minor, how do I file this money for taxes? Am I even able to file taxes since the money I earned was earned on a website where I violated TOS? The LAST thing I need is to have the IRS come back on me for tax evasion when I'm 30 years old.

I understand what I have done here is wrong, but it was all unintentional. I didn't create an account for Upwork with the intention of violating the TOS.

If you guys could help me out, it would be highly appreciated.

1478,"I have just started my part-time job as a freelance web designer. I work full time but do this in my spare time.

I have registered myself as self employed so that I can do a self assessment at the end of the tax year.

I thought about creating a ltd company but I thought it would be easier for me to just be a sole trader. 

You may have noticed at the end of websites you see ""Website by X"" and it would link to a website, usually.

My problem is I don't want to have my name on things like that. I don't want ""Website by John Doe"", I would rather ""website by CompanyNameIMadeUp""

Not having anything on the website at all isn't really an option because I still need to gain more clients, and that is a sure way to get people to my website.

Also on my website I dont my name as the domain, like johndoewebdesign.com. The main reason for this is for my privacy. I don't want people I know such as collegues to find it, or do a google search on my name and find it. I would rather my website and e-mail address be something that doesn't immediately identify myself.

So, can I legally put ""website by CompanyNameIMadeUp"" or would I need to create a ltd company in my name in order to do that legally?

If a ltd company is the only way around not putting my name, what further implications do I face when it comes to self assessment?

I've checked on Companies House and my
ideal company name has not been taken

1479,"I'm currently doing a website for a client as a freelance web developer. We had our first meetup and we discussed what he wants on the website, what his company does, etc.  I coming up with the pages that he will need, such as products, services, contact etc. There were a few others related to his business. I showed him my initial draft of the website, which included the links that will be at the top navigator. He was happy with my initial draft.

However by our second meeting he had sketched together a very similar design to mine but with a few tweeks. This is fine and I didn't have any problems with these changes.
However there was two things I noticed that I didn't like. 

He had added two new links to the top menu of the website. These links are ""About Us"" and ""News"". When I asked him how does he want the news section to work ( does he want it linking to a new Wordpress?), which I was a bit reluctant about because it means more work for me with the same pay, he simply replied ""I don't know. I did research on my competitors and they all had it"". I died inside at this. 

I decided to tell him quickly that there's no point in having the page if he doesn't know what he's going to do, how he's going to write up this news, or doesn't have time to do it. He then said ok we wont use ""News"". But by our next meeting he had referred to a newer version of his sketch, and it still included a ""News"" link. I asked him about it, reminding him that we agreed to get rid of it, and he said ""Well I thought we could just have a link to my Twitter"".

I'm not sure if he wants a new page to just display one twitter icon, to use a twitter api thing that shows tweets, or to have the main link direct to his twitter. I feel like I'm a broken record with him and don't know how to say ""that's a bit rubbish to do/it will look poor"".
A similar thing is with his ""About Us"" section. While I find that the page may be necessary, I don't feel it needs to be at the top of the page, but rather in a footer with the Cookies Policy and other things no one cares about.

How can I raise these points to him without offending him? I've always told him I would always provide my professional oppinion if necessary, but now that I think it is - I don't know how!

Some information: - the man is a sucessful business person and a little intimidating
- His business has been going for about 2 years and makes a lot of money but this is his first website

Is it reasonable for me to suggest that we don't need to meet? can talk on phone/email instead? 

I feel between developers, we understand things can be handled virtually. But client is not very tech savvy to begin with. So I understand the client's proposal to meet. But at the same time, I don't want to meet with the client because time consuming and the fact that I'm a female developer.

Since he is in the UK and I am in India, I figured that was the only way. After struggling to pay through PayPal (he said there was fraud comitted on that account) and me not having a bank account in the UK, he ended up paying me on Freelancer. Months post that, he used my services, apologized as he was traveling/facing trouble with the bank/was hospitalized - all the excuses in the book, and till date has not paid me.

We will meet up shortly to do the hand-over process, where I show him everything that's done, tell him how log in to his accounts once I'm no longer around, how to see his analytics, what to do if he needs any help, and just an overall summary of service.

However I thought of a question I could ask him during this meeting a while back. I made a mental note to do a closing interview/questionnaire when I'm done if I think of more questions.

Only problem is I can't remember what that question is. Maybe it wasn't important. But it got me thinking:


Should I do a closing interview?
If so, what should I say?


I don't want to ask ""Overall are you happy with your service?"" because I feel like we wouldn't have got all the way to the end if they were not so the question might be pointless, and I don't want them to feel I'm just asking to big up an ego.

1493,"I am 22 years old, seeking guidance on how to convert my already ""malicious"" life style to a legal one. Without giving up too much information, I am asking for help (and I promise, it's worth a read).

A Little Background

When I was young (10-12) years old, I lived in I guess what many would call a poor life (though it seemed rather normal to me). Water, power, and internet would often be shut off. Due to my inability to bathe sometimes in the morning before school I'd get bullied often at school. I didn't coward away, I'd stand my ground, but It was a rough public school with 4,000+ kids from all around the city. I started to get to me, along with my parents drug use. So being young I tried to take matters into my own hands. When I was 12, I would sneak out of my house and break into cars and houses for extra cash. When I was finally able to buy myself some clothes and a new phone I was slowly beginning to be more accepted (I was one of the few white kids in my school). I felt a sense of accomplishment, but of course I knew what I was doing was wrong, but after seeing your family struggle you begin not to care, especially at a young age. So things only got worse from there.

I got accepted into a High School University (A high school that offers college classes, so you can graduate with a diploma and an associates degree). But later that year I found myself deeper into the world of crime than I would have ever thought I would be. I found myself craving the thrill of being chased, shot at, and needed more of it. Nothing my friends did at the age of 15-16 amused me. Everything seemed boring at that point except crime. By the time I was 19, and had been kicked out of school for truancy, I was already proficient in:


Hacking Embedded Devices (Electronically opening cars and garages with spoofed radio frequency using an Arduino)
Creating Exploits and Hacking Computers, Mobile Devices
Manipulating (I was really good at extracting information from corporate companies and people in general) 
Cloning Chip / PIN Cards , RFID Badges, Magnetic Strip Cloning
Cryptography, Stenography, and Staying Anonymous
Buying and Selling on Black Markets (Card dumps, Hack tools, Guides etc)
Creation of Drugs
Firing Weapons
Money Laundering


The list goes on...

What I Tried to do to Escape the Life

I later became an Intelligence Analyst with a Top Secret Clearance for the United States Army (Ironic, isn't it). I worked in the headquarters of the 101st Airborne Division for nearly a year before being discharged medically (more because I felt like I didn't belong). I was surrounded by a life that didn't feel like mine. I wanted my old life back. Now, I'm 22, trying to utilize my skills, my passion, my love in life -the right way. I tried finishing college; however, I still don't do well in school (lack of motivation, caring). I read and learn all the time, constantly. I'm pretty anti-social, reading and inventing throughout my day, but when I need to be social I am fine. I never went to jail or prison, but it's almost destined to happen. I need legal help on how I can possible do something along my passion, legally.
